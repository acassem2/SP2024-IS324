 '>I read some simple program got some trouble. First, how can i check outputs result. When using cout statement, the outputs are shown very short time jaws doesn\'t read them. Use the function Pause ( ). How to use it depends on if you are using win32, MFC, or C++ / CLR. Second, how can I check where mistake are. It only say "" build error "" when debugging. Does it show exactly what the mistake is like jaws script? JAWS scripts are not for Visual Studio 2010. If you want to check the results of the build process, use the output window found by going to the menu view>output window, or view>other windows>output window. Which menu placement of the output window is going to depend on your local setup, how often the output window is used. Last, how to create an EXE file? the applications key on the solution or project, then press ENTER on build, or rebuild. It may help to clean the project before rebuilding it, especially if you recently had build problems. If you want to use the menu system, go to project>build, project>rebuild, or project>clean project. After a successful build, you will have a. exe file, along with all of its supporting / dependent projects the projects bin / debug or bin / release folders. Again, this folder layout will depend on what type of C++ you are using, your active configuration settings Visual Studio, some settings defined the tools>options window.'
 'Can I use this. exe file without the supporting / dependent projects?'
 'What dependencies your program has is a matter of the project configurations, there is no simple yes or no answer to that question.'
 'No. For example, if you have a class library ( dll ) project that is used by your cli application, the dll has to be copied / moved / distributed with the. exe file. Failing to do so will give you strange results, which will typically end up some runtime error. Otherwise, if your. exe project has no custom built dependencies, all that needs to be on the target is the system wide libraries used by the project. A common one is mscorelib. dll or shell32. dll.'

Supposedly, if the USING statement is not necessary, it is the color grey, giving the user a visual clue that it is not necessary to have this line the. cs file. How do I get JAWS to identify this to me? JAWS + 5 is only telling me black on black everywhere the file. JAWS + f is not giving me any different font information across the different lines. Any suggestions? I have other questions around things that seem to only be identified through color changes, so I'll just leave it for now with the above question. Thank you.""
 'lack of font info you describe is one thing I have found very annoying VS since the switch to WPF. If I change the speech sound scheme setting to "" visual studio. net colors "" then jaws will say the color information ( not sure where it is looking that jaws+5 doesn\'t ) but that might be annoying for other lines, depending on your preferences. I know on the context menu there is an item for removing unneeded using statements, I forget its exact location don\'t have a C # project open right now to look. However, unneeded using statements C # also don\'t have nearly the impact that unneeded # includes will c or c++.'
 'I tried setting the Speech Sound Scheme setting as you described: using System. Collections. Generic; will now say keyword using black System. Collections. Generic; It will say "" keyword "" "" black "" on each line. So, no go for me least. other setting sounds interesting, could be a nice workaround. Thank you.'
 'Oh, after some additional thought a little investigation I\'m guessing it\'s done by making the unneeded using least somewhat transparent rather than by changing the actual color. And I am thinking jaws doesn\'t know how to look that ( that jaws looks what the color was before manipulation rather than what ends up on screen ). I looked through the "" fonts colors "" list VS under tools - >options environment didn\'t find anything that looked like it would apply ( which is where I got the idea that VS may do this through transparency ). I was hoping to be able to apply a custom color to just that item then you could have jaws look for that color rather than the more general "" keyword "" color, but no dice. Sorry I could not find something that would actually help.'
 ""Thanks a bunch for directing brain cycles towards this issue.; ) I'm still working towards finding a way to determine this... just so frustrating.""
 'I don ’ t hav a solution for you, but, if all you want is to remove the unused usings, visual studio has this option the context menu, the refactor submenu, I think.'

However, the book I am using tends to make an excessive use of mutater methods instead of using get / set sections of properties. So, instead of something like: bank account class is the base class for a savings account a checking account. base class has the set / get mutaters for most of the accounts properties ( private fields ). In the derived classes, the same set / get mutaters are supposed to be used to setup the balance other properties of the derived account, as well as use its own set / get mutaters to finish the setup process. These set / get methods are supposed to be public services of the class. This sounds strange to me because I never see get / set methods on any. net provided object. What I would do is make the get / set methods protected, then provide public properties inside the derived classes. Any idea why the excessive use of get / set methods would be used over properties?'
 'Hi, If this is anything like Python, from what I understand, I have a limited education, it just gives you a way to use the properties as if they were variables. In other words instead of calling a function from the outside, you simply refer to the property by either using it or assigning to it. Thanks.'
 'FWIW WPF uses mutators instead of properties ( even the properties that do exist are actually implemented terms of mutator methods instead of direct backing fields ).'
 'I am going to talk to the professor tomorrow because there seems to be come confusion on what needs to be done. I looked the b=section of the book again, it uses properties instead of mutaters, but the assignment wants us to use mutaters... book never talks about mutaters all.'
 ""Have you talked about get methods set methods? I believe mutate or's are the same as set methods.""
 'They are, but the book never mentions anything about mutaters. All it does is use public properties to access members of a base class. homework wants us to use mutaters instead of peroperties...'
 ""So? use a method instead of a property: instead of: class P ropertyExample { int foo _; int foo { get { return foo _; } set { foo _ = value; } } } it would be: class MutatorExample { int _ foo; int GetFoo ( ) { return _ foo; } void SetFoo ( int newValue ) { _ foo = newValue; } } Properties are really just syntax sugar anyway, there's nothing particularly magical about them.""

If folks run into issues with it, please let me know I ’ ll see if I can help identify who would need to fix the experience. That way, we can make sure that the people who can actually correct it have the information. - -'

If can perform magic to change their mind that would be very good since pretty much every c # developer I know over here uses it to boost their productivity not having it can be a decent blow to productivity compared to your sighted peers who do use this extension. experience asking for these improvements sadly were very disappointing.""

Before I increase this, I need to figure out a few things. Currently, I'm reflecting on the best approach for the database implementation. entire catalog has been chopped up a dynamically scalable cubic matrix of regions, each holding stars that are within its boundaries. many regions have 0 stars, which is fine, but there are others which hold over 100k stars. So I subdivide regions to smaller region matrices. Everything is connected on a quad tree like structure so I can move a set of nodes or out of memory, I can get the relevant nodes injected on demand. Now for the database question: Is it better if I create several databases holding level 1 regions say, or is it better I create multiple tables of level 1, level 2, level n regions within one single database? What are the advantages caveats for both strategies? I know strategy 1 is good for redundancy, map reduce functionality, having a heterogeneous database setup if required. But is there anything the second strategy might be more advantageous? Any suggestions or opinions very welcome.""

 ""Hi, You only need to add references using the Add Reference dialog if the namespace you're needing is not already added by default. This is not always obvious, as quite often you need to drill down into a namespace to find out if what you want is there or another similarly named library. Strictly speaking, the Imports statement does not add a reference to anything all. All it does is create an established default namespace your code module, so that you don't have to explicitly code it every line. E. g. you can put this the top of a module: Imports System. Data. SQLClient then your code refer to: Dim cnnData As SQLConnection Or if you leave out the Imports statement, you could equally say: Dim cnnData As System. Data. SQLClient. SQLConnection advantage of the Imports statement is that if you are going to refer to objects many times your code module, it saves you having to fully qualify them every time. You can only add an Imports statement for a namespace that is a referenced library. By default, Windows projects for example, VS will automatically add references to System, System. Data, System. Windows. Forms, System. Drawing, I think System. XML. System. Remoting. InteropServices is part of the System. dll library I believe.""

 ""Hi, If by virtual PCs, you mean a VDI ( Virtual Desktop Interface ) using VMWare 6, then, unfortunately, no, JAWS does not work. I'm presently going through this whole heartache, after what seemed initially favourable results with JAWS, my company bought a remote licence only to find that it doesn't work after all; this has been confirmed by Sight Sound / Freedom Scientific. On the other hand, Window - Eyes does work.""
 'HI, Could you be a little more specific? Saying "" video intercept chokes "" doesn\'t tell me anything. I\'ve used JAWS successfully on virtual servers via Remote Desktop. But I\'m specifically interested the use of virtual PCs with a thin client terminal. I. e. not having a physical desktop PC to work from. Applications analyst Tel: ( 01392 ) 382464'
 ""Thanks once again, I'm hoping to find out specifically which technology is being used soon. Your information is very useful. Sadly, Window Eyes isn't an option for me, because it just doesn't cut the mustard with the development tools I need to use. Applications analyst Tel: ( 01392 ) 382464""

 ""Messagehello, Sory - - I thought you were refering to just a vm tyep setup for a sandbox environment or similar. Are you just asking for a remote - type connection, something like VNC, remote desktop, etc? I think vmware also allows for you to control it across the network - - but I could be wrong. regarding the video, jaws is unable to install it's hook the chain. I'm not quite sure if this is a vmware specific issue, or something with windows; I'm going to look to that this weekend. Before it being able to install it's hooks, it's pretty much useless as it doesn't read edit boxes, virtualized window, etc etc.""
 'I\'m not asking about remote connection, as I already know how that works as mentioned my reply below. I also know that JAWS does work if installed on a virtual server, then connected to via Remote Desktop from a standard workstation PC> So it would appear that JAWS can least hook into the display driver on the virtual server as long as JAWS is installed on that server. That\'s just normal behaviour for remote access. I\'m specifically interested the situation where JAWS is installed on a virtual PC, the user operates this virtual PC from a thin client device, what we of the mainframe days still prosaically call a "" dumb terminal "". If virtual PCs use the same technology as the virtual servers, I can\'t logically see why JAWS shouldn\'t work exactly the same on the virtual machine. problem is that to connect to a virtual machine currently requires that I have a normal PC which has JAWS installed running on it. I\'m assuming that the thin client terminal wouldn\'t permit this, thus meaning it\'s impossible to access the virtual machine, regardless of whether it\'s a PC or server or what technology is used to virtualise it. Applications analyst Tel: ( 01392 ) 382464'
 ""Hi, This isn't a configuration I've tried, or encountered with any of my old customers when I worked for Blazie, but I think it might be possible given the following: 1 - Jaws is installed running on the remote machine ( you won't need a remote licence ); 2 - thin net mechanism delivers keystrokes accurately from the terminal to the remote machine - any translation things are likely to break; 3 - There is a mechanism for the audio output of the remote machine to be delivered via speakers attached to the terminal ( if you can get Windows sounds delivered out of the terminal's speakers, then there's no reason why you won't hear Eloquence over the link ). Well, that's it for the theory, but I'd insist on a demonstration as proof of concept before handing over anybody's cash.""
 ""Thanks for the thoughts, I'm hoping to least find out about, if not get my hands on, one of the terminal devices to see if I can test it out. It would seem to me that it should be a simple matter to do, as creating a virtual PC, installing JAWS on it, then trying to use the darn thing should be achievable a morning. If only this had all been considered up front, instead of as an afterthought because I kept complaining... I doubt I'll be able to influence the handing over or not of cash however.

I have a business to run. I would like a program which tells me what each on my network is running, showing a starting ending time. I do not want to see normal essential for the running of the operating system. However, I do wish to see whether or not someone was playing Spider Solitaire for two or three hours my time. Which turn, could get tricky, since reality, I mostly want to see what is focus. I\'d also like to see how much data was send to a local printer, for example. ( Network printers have their own logs on the Server ) Now some may call this spying on colleagues, but for the exercise I\'ll call it "" Load Balancing "". Since all my systems are running XP Professional, networked to a Windows 2003 Enterprise Server, this could be a tricky one for you. This is a serious enquiry, especially since you asked about specific projects.. This Message has been scanned for viruses by McAfee Groupshield.'
 ""I wouldn't call this spying on your workers. like a checksum of work productivity. There are tools out there to look for slacking, but don't think it will do all that you outlined. What you want would be a nice program for business productivity.""
 ""I'm glad you agree, since productivity was pretty much are the forefront of my thinking..""
 'george, your willing to wait for a few hours for this one? ok, I am willing to do it, but will need help the process, can you send me more details on the system? What how do you want it to work? just explain yourself a little more, I have a big idea of what you want, but will need more info..'
 'yes it would... I am thinking of some possibilities for this one... but ya, it would be nice, not only for you, but for some etc...'
 'Hi, Let me remind you up front that I am NOT a programmer, analyst or any such thing. I am a plain simple user, who is all too often on the receiving end of software under development, which ultimately I have to use for my business, many cases actually sell. So all I can do is tell you what I want layman\'s terms. I\'m possibly a typical sort of manager who knows enough to be dangerous. Basically, I want to get some kind of report of what my employees are doing or running on their systems. And as you probably already know, you can be running many applications, but only one actually has focus. And as you also probably know, switching from one application to another can be done with a couple of keystrokes, or a click of the mouse. So this guy has been playing solitaire for ages - he hears me walk up the stairs, quickly switches to Outlook so that when I see his screen, I\'m supposed to think he\'s busy dealing with mail. I want a log that says words to the effect of: - UserName = Workstation = 192. 168. 1. 12 In focus Solitaire = 10: 37: 00 to 11. 05: 00 Background = Outlook, Excel,. Currently running Outlook ( from 11: 05: 15 ) Background = Excel, Solitaire. a similar report for other users. It\'s basically a kind of "" Event Log "" I guess. Am I making sense so far?. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _'
 ""Now you are putting your thinking cap on - that's good. Indeed I'm sure there are many teachers who would like to know who is doing what. Like - - - Oh yes, everyone is looking the History Project, but what's doing running Visual Basic? thinking..""
 ""yes, so do you want this stored a file? a program that when you open it it will display all of this? how do you want the program to be ran on there systems? as a service etc? Also, I am thinking, how do you want the configuration, do you want to put all the ip addresses to monitor a. ini file on your system, just have the program started as a service? wouldn't it be better for me to get a list of all currently running programs? for how long they have been ran for etc? I have a good idea of what you want now, this is going to take a lot of work though, anyone willing to help or am I supposed to do it all on my own? I don't mind helpiung or doing it on my own, I just haven't done a program like this before...""
 'the school has a sort of monitoring thing, but it takes three keystrokes, it is gone, the teacher has no clue... its funny.'
 'another idea, maybe I could just output this to a log file, make a console based program that will just sort of let you update the log ( get data from all connected users ) delete the log ( the contents of the file ) etc?'
 'Remember I\'m just the user - so my answers may not compute your terms. I would imagine the overall monitoring program would ideally have to be run from a server. As for it being a "" "" - pass. I don\'t know. It would require a log - the form of a text file I guess. That file would be crucial evidence when if I have to take an employee to task. And yes, I would like to be able to see a snapshot of who is doing what any time.

So there's a lot of stuff out there, but, well to put it nicely, nothing is too impressive. Keep mind I am not a gamer, I have only started dabbling blind games since say. What I have found is that a lot of the cool games, such as fps's all go the way of the dodo bird never see the of day again that's pretty sad. Yes there are what people are calling clones out there these kids get hell for it, plus these games like rotu, daily life, red spot, tk, etc etc were all written bgt which is an old dead toolkit. I'm curious to know if maybe I could have a discussion with someone outline the ideas I have for a game similar to those I mentioned above, but written say python / or c then ultimately, make that code available on github to bring new ideas from the outside. I think that is the fundamental problem with these games. Everyone wants to talk about how person A stole bgt code from person B it turns into a shame game which isn't very productive. I mean, does it honestly matter if BGT is considered abandenware none of these projects were registered IP? I don't know. But my vision for such a game would use a surround sound audio engine, high quality sounds, many round robin samples so forth. I don't believe nickle diming players so I'm not really interested. I've heard making a game like this open source would be a bad idea since people could make forks of it, but that's the entire point of having it open source creating forks, people can do as they wish with it. Where would I start with this? Someone mentioned to me that yeah it's a great idea but if it was so great, why hasn't it been done already? Well just like a crypto trading chart, why hasn't anyone done it already? What do you guys think is this worth pursuing? - - Accessible Specialist Portland Community College CCENT, Network+, A+""
 'Hello. I would first ask if by "" surround sound "" you are talking about a four or five or maybe more speakers sound system? if that is so... not sure how many people have such configuration ( also connected to their computers ). Do not know. I do like the idea of creating an accessible video game make the source code open, some games already did that ( for different reasons ). But first I would like to understand a little bit more about your goals, like, you want to sell the game? do it as a learning experience? just for fun? what kind of game do you envision? action? first person shooter? With those kind of parameters then we can start talking about language or game engine or if the source can or needs to be open.'
 ""No no, by surround sound I'm talking about 3d audio. If you are wearing headphones you'll be able to tell if an object is behind you or front of you. idea is a first person shooter with freedom to create maps, objects things like that. I do not wish to sell the game. In fact, I'd like to make the code available so that more people can contribute their ideas make the game better. I am currently trying to learn python to try get my feet wet with programming maybe come up with a concept. But this will take quite a while.""
 'Hi, Interesting you should talk about game development. First of all, let me pick up on one of your phrases: "" you guys who are much smarter than I am "". That resonates with me so deeply. I don\'t mind admitting that I feel like a complete dunderhead here. About 95 % of the emails I get from here make me think I\'m a metaphorical passenger eavesdropping on an aircraft cockpit. I might be a competent BGT scripter, but that\'s hardly something to crow about. For whatever reason, all atempts becoming a programmer rather than just a BGT scripter have so far stuck the mud, whether that\'s contributing to existing projects or trying to realise my own ideas. I\'ve been looking for a mentor or a learning companion for some time now. primary language of choice would be C or C++, but I\'m not completely against Python if it proves to be a better alternative. I\'d be interested to hear your thoughts.'
 ""there, I tend to agree with you. C is really what I attempted learning several times but it has always ended up making my head hurt I lose interest quite quickly. But this is more of a me problem than anything. Maybe getting with someone learning together may help that. BGT has a lot of limitations, like I think only supporting up to 10, 000 variables so it's really not suitable for large scale game development. of mine said bgt lowered the barrier to entry for people but...... lol, maybe that means I'm just dumb because it looked like any other language to me. But I really don't think using it is a good idea. Would you want to learn a language together maybe try our hand something? I'm down for any ideas, I just want to make something fun that everyone will enjoy. view on games is that they should be fun, not cost people lots of money like some out there. Nothing against them, I just have a different viewpoint. Also keep my I am not a gamer either I just happened to start venturing into this space around 6 months ago. A game isn't really the best thing as a first project for a newbie, so I thought reaching out may prove useful to some degree to get some ideas.""

Nothing against them, I just have a different viewpoint. Also keep my I am not a gamer either I just happened to start venturing into this space around 6 months ago. A game isn't really the best thing as a first project for a newbie, so I thought reaching out may prove useful to some degree to get some ideas.""
 'problem with that language is it gets you no where. Yes you can right games it. You can learn to code but tell me just one commercial thing written it. It is like learning to code with Blockely or scratch. You still have to relearn with a real language the end.'
 ""Yeah, that's exactly what a friend of mine told me. also said that if I really wanted to code a game I'm probably better off going with a combination of python C #. I'm interested what languages you are considering learning. I know the basics, declaring variables print statements, but that's about it.""
 '' 'Wonderful, quite interested.'
 ""In my opinion Python C # both are better choices, however, I'm not sure about the accessibility of unity. If unity is accessible for us, then it will be a great aid game development""
 ""Hi everyone. you ’ re doing great. now, I read the complete conversation. Let me tell you something. all the things that you're talking about, me my teacher. We are working on all of them. We are working with C #. We are working on full gaming environment including binaural game engine. a dashboard. some cool games. Engine is almost done. it is very much detailed. You will be surprised when you'll see that. Very soon, everything will be released for the public. Now, we ’ re working on the dashboard, the games that are progress. So, just wait for the release. I ’ m sure, you ’ ll love it. Arqam Mehmood.""
 ""Oh really, that's great. Where can I keep up to date with it. What will it be called? Do you have any more details about what the game will be about? it be open source / or a server made available?""
 'it be open source?'
 'I definitely think It would be cool to learn together. Then we can brainstorm instead of cause a storm our brain.'
 ""Hi, That would be great. Only problem is, I closed my account down with Discord because I found the interface far too cumbersome. I've heard it has improved a lot since then, but now it seems I can't rejoin because they've started using HCaptcha who insist that my email address is fake. Nuff said.""
 ""Hi, Wow, it really does sound like we're both kind of the same level then. While I could probably learn other API's easily enough, it's knowing where to start, A, finding the right ones for your use case, B, knowing how to compile them if they are open source, C, distributing all the right files so it works on other machines, D, making sure everything's up to date without breaking anything, so on so forth. That's why the moment I've been tying myself to the Windows API, even then, you forget to link one library the compiler throws a fit it takes you forever to realise why.""
 ""Funny funny. If C # is a modern popular option I'd be down to learn that. But I do want to ask you guys if any of you have heard of D, the D programming language?""
 ""Hi, first preference would be C C++, interpreted languages are generally too slow insecure for my liking. But having said that, apart from the indentation, I can't deny that I like some of the Python language concepts as well, not to mention how versatile it is. I have also been interested learning assembly, but that's more a curiosity than anything else. I don't know why you would use it other than if you're going to go into something like reverse engineering.""
 ""Hi, Yes I have. 't know what it's like though, but given that my D installer also wants to install Visual Studio suggests to me that it's just another wrapper on top of C or something like that. Could be totally wrong though.""
 ''
 'As for Assembly why you would want to know it. I am about to release a project that I wrote C but it could have been done better assembler if I wanted to. There are also still a lot of low level jobs that will never go away. If you learn assembler writing for all these Maker chips becomes much more interesting it teaches you a lot about what is going on with all these other languages.'
 ''
 ""Use all available post build tools to track down the problem. For a decent size project, it helps to run it through a debugger. For things that are difficult to track down with a debugger, dump out a stack trace if it is available your programming language. After a while, you will have an idea what certain entries mean. This takes care of the bugs / linking problem. rest of it depends on preference project requirements. Choosing a library or API will prove difficult if you don't know what the project will look like. So, define the project requirements / features. Once solid, go find the libraries or APIs to use.""
 'Hi, In theory, sounds dead simple. In practice though, it goes way over my head.'
 ''
 'Hi, Probably showing my ignorance yet again, but I thought C # was a. net - based language,. net is Windows, or least Microsoft, specific?'
 '' ''
 'C # runs mono cross platform we build totally cross platform apps with xamrin c #'
 ""I'd definitely be interested a learning group, on Discord is fine. I've learned a bit of Python, but also like the idea of web dev, so JS, Ruby's package manager, least, is really nice lol.""
 'I never have liked the gems but it is not much different then pip cargo.'
 'I just like that you can do gem update it updates everything, no pipupgrade needed.'
 'Yes but that can cause problems if you don ’ t want some things done.'
 'Interesting. I thought D was based on C was much more modern than 17 years. They say it can be used to write almost anything.'
 ""How would one go about writing a server for something written bgt? Bgt has no network components, so can input be passed to bgt from multiple players.... I'm assuming the game code itself would run on the server while the client is just some small front end to access the server.... or do I have that wrong.""
 ""I have to ask but isn't blast pretty much dead I have not seen updates since 2017.""
 ""Yes, it is dead but it is just a place for me to start getting my feet wet. I'll move on to more complex languages like python next.""
 ""Hi, Actually, there is a network object BGT based on ENet. It's essentially a P2P setup using UDP but you can also use it as a client - server system as well.""
 ""Let me ask a question that almost everyone that works on these kind of things for the last 30 years fails on miserably. There are several game platforms out even dev kits for making audio games or playing card games with multiple people. problem is they never seem to do both sighted / vision. In other words if I go to something like Quent C for all their cool games. Then I try to play cribbage with my wife. She will not even play it because it is all text based truth awful looking for a sighted person. the day of Yahoo's pogo platform I was working with them to try to get them accessible but they never did it. So before I ask my question here is my dream. dream platform which I am slowly putting together my head which once I am not working on all the projects I am already doing I will get to. Is a card table. Sure that sounds easy but what I want is like nothing anyone out there has wrote yet. I like playing cards of all kinds but the thing that fails on line is you can not just sit down the table with a deck of cards. Or eight decks of cards play what ever game you want with how many you want the rules you want. I am working on making a online server client game where that is exactly how it works it will work for sighted, blind, low vision it will not matter. sighted will see graphics. blind will play with something like the quent c platform. sad part is so many people have come close but they don't go far enough. You should not have to play the game they have ready for you. You should not have to script a game. It should be up to you to play score the game should look good for everyone. Sure you should have different decks peg boards things that you can use to make play games like cribbage or maybe a made up game with 4 dice, a coin, a deck of cards, two dominoes. When you sit the table you should be able to play just like if you were sitting the room with your little brother getting ready to cheat him out of his Halloween candy. Anyway I have said all that to ask. Is your game multi - player multi - ability? ken""
 ""I like your thought process. It should be playable by both sighted non - sighted alike. Yes, I do want to have multi player access. I'm working on setting up a very crude server trying to figure out the best way to create store maps python, it looks like having a list with 3 indexes is probably the way to go, then create a loop that accepts keyboard arrow input stop when the boundary of either the x or y position has been met. But this is very crude I'm going to have to use Py Game to do this. I'm trying to learn python while trying to build something useful the same time it is very slow. These tutorials assume you just know the parameters of these functions libraries you almost need to read the documentation for every part of a library function just to know what values it expects just to use it. Very tedious indeed.""
 'Hello, You just expressed my pain. So many times I wanted to play Monopoly with my wife, my daughter her husband ( all sighted ), or cards, or dominos online, but no platform offers both accessibility playability for the sighted. \'s playroom is extremely good for the blind ( I know you\'re here, so thank you so much! ), but it would be nice to have card pictures least, so the sighted wouldn\'t read text messages like "" jack of diamonds "" which is counterintuitive for them. - - With best'
 ""I will also mention. Quenten was not to nice to my wife when she couldn't log on a while ago. She was able to remake another account get it to work. Now though she says she has trouble putting scores for cribbage etc. making an accessible game should be accessible usible for all not designed for one group or another.""
 ""Hello, I'm reading through the topic saw what you have said about the playroom. OF course, ideally, it should be equally accessible to everybody. But it's incredibly hard to achieve, even more when you are alone don't have all required competences. I'm aware that pure text isn't ideal for sighted people, but I'm trying to do my best. I'm alone. I don't have any sighted developer to help me, so I do what I can. If you are sighted or partially sighted, developer, willing to help, please contact me we'll change the world. Remember also that the playroom is totally free, totally made on free time, so is all the work made by me other people who aren't developers ( helpers or translators for example ). Paying someone to do the job is thus excluded as well. At least there is text on screen to be read by sighted people. It's a little awful, but it's playable. This isn't even the case for another popular platform, just case.""
 'This is something you should post on your page It would also help if you were not rude to people having trouble logging as sighted people. I have some sighted programmers that might be interested. I will talk to them next week.'
 'Hello, This is something you should post on your page Right now the topic "" improvements for sighted "" is kind of stand - by. Pretty open if an opportunity comes, but not actively working on it the moment. It would also help if you were not rude to people having trouble logging as sighted people. I don\'t think I ever have been rude, it should have been a misstake. I don\'t handle login issues other support of the same kind myself since a long time. I don\'t like doing support or the police all I have got the chance to let other people ( helpers ) do it for me. Maybe you have got a problem with a particular helper, it isn\'t impossible. I\'m sorry, but it\'s not my fault. Normally the community should be pretty friendly / helpful general. And afterall, remember that the playroom is totally free. We have no obligation to do support all.'
 ""Then you have answered my question two bad ways. One is you are not the person who is where the buck stops. Two you don't care if sighted people will ever be able to play. That is fine to me that means your just like All play or other groups that has done this the past. It is fine there is a place for games like yours. It is not what I am looking for though.""
 ""Hello, you don't care if sighted people will ever be able to play. That's not true. Though not the most ideal, sighted people can still play. I think I have done what I can with my means. However, where you are right, is that it isn't my main objective. playroom hasn't been designed with sighted people mind, that's a fact. I don't want to rebuild everything from scratch either. you are not the person who is where the buck stops Sorry but I'm not sure to well understand that expression, as my native language isn't english. I'm a developer, the case of the playroom, the creator. I don't like doing support. I don't see where there is a problem.""
 'Hi kperry, \'t be too hard on. I know him, he is a generous man, even sometimes he can be a little frisky to move on some topics. And considering what he gives freely to the community or he has already done, he should be thanked for my own point of view. By experience, even if doesn\'t seam thrilled for now by an idea, it doesn\'t mean he will never. Push him a little, give him free space to rethink about it for a little time. Maybe the problem you don\'t see is he can feel trapped sometimes by its own creation. From my side, I am the developper of the visugame platform, where are also regrouped free online games for blinds. goal I gave to the visugame is officially to become a platform where games are accessible to everyone, blinds or sighted, on pc or on, from africa or anywhere else. However, I have to recognise it is a very difficult task to achieve. Because, as a lonely man, a man that is otherwize occupied, there is a lot of things to do. There are too much demands for me to handle according to my state of business. That\'s why I think now the main goal for a creator of such a platform, should be to give tools to members of its community to do exactly what they want, like you can hear with roblox for example. I believe it was Franc that wrote: "" most important thing parents can teach to their children, is the ability to live without them. "" Not that I am considering my community is my children, but you get the idea. That\'s why I have started to develop a kind of environment to create games for the visugame platform, first with knowledge programming. After, why not progress to a kind of no code environment like a scratch for example, where anybody would just have to displace logical blocks? to create games or to personalize the platform. And of course the ability to share ones customizations. I don\'t also forget the other possibility that is to open once source codes make them available on a git repository. But for this one, as I\'ve already said, I don\'t believe much github. This time, the one that is frisky is me. Maybe you should push me? LOL! From Cameroon, central Africa.'
 ""I have been running a commercial game since 1995. I know what he goes through I had 38, 000 users with much more trouble than he has now. game has died down since text based games are not something sighted people have played as much since 1998 when the good GUI multi player games really hit their strive. With that said. When you run a game like this you are either involved. Or not. If he is involved my wife would have never had the trouble she did with her password. It was a bug the game when she asked about it she was ignored. could be a saint that would still be a problem. I don't expect him to change his game. If the game has problems though they should not be ignored. If it didn't reach his ears that there were problems then again that is even a bigger problem. I don't mind if he includes sighted people or not. I know what I like his game as it is but without including sighted people I would rather not play there since I would like it better if I could play with all my friends not just a limited small set. That is up to him. Tech support is also up to him but that is something that affects everyone.""

 'As I said I have no problem with playing on the play room. She had to make a different account because her old account is still screwed up. We tried it out. She said the interface for asighted is not a good layout looked very spread out strange. At first she had trouble even entering the count on cribbage over all she was not interested playing it since it was very blank screen text only. I was talking to a couple sighted coders. They were wondering if you have an API they can use to make a sighted friendly interface or is your stuff open source?'
 ""Hello, I was talking to a couple sighted coders. They were wondering if you have an API they can use to make a sighted friendly interface or is your stuff open source? No, there is no API, no, it isn't open source. I'm generally quite a fan of open source, but the case of an online game like the playroom, I don't see well how I could make it open source without making it also open bar for an army of cheaters hackers. I don't want either to allow other people to run their own server. problem of that is fragmentation of the community. It's certainly not desirable, since beyond just playing games, the playroom is also used as a kind of social network. It must also remain easy to use for people with almost no knowledge, because this point is also one of the strength of the playroom ( I can confirm that some people on the playroom are 85 years old more ). That's a very interesting question fact. Do you know of any game ( including mainstream ) that are open source, online persistent, not full of cheaters hackers? Personally I don't know if one exists. Additionally, if I wanted to make the protocol of the playroom open source or usable like an API, I would need to refactor quite a lot of things. What I use isn't very standard, consequence of non - optimal choices I made along the 12 years of existence of the playroom, a time I never thought that it would grow so much. For example, I don't use JSON because I didn't know that it existed 12 years ago, I don't always use HTML the way I should have, I implemented my own websocket implementation, etc. This is the kind of thing very hard to change now that some parts of the code base are 12 years old.""

 ""Hello, It can be done easily if you compile a key that way people could make all the stuff they want but without the right key they can not connect. I don't think it's as easy as you say. If the client / or the protocol is open source, I think that we can also consider that the API key ( or whatever you call it ) is open or will eventually be open, too. IF you know the protocol, it means that you can easily sniff it, find the API key, do whatever you want with it afterwards. Any client developer may also leak the API key its open sourced code. Of course, being closed source don't protect all from this, but open source probably makes is much easier. I consider it as a little invitation.

I have no idea but this is kinda cool.""

If they had the source they could compile it but they oculdn ’ t connect without the key you control.

If they had the source they could compile it but they oculdn ’ t connect without the key you control. I think you are a little contradicting yourself. client can't both be open source contain a secret key it. For me, open source means by definition that you can compile run on your own without restriction. If a secret key need to be compiled into the client order to work, it's no longer open source. If a key is needed, it has necessarily to be configured externally some way. And this, turn, means that the user has to request one himself, which is probably going to not be very user friendly for many users. Finally, I can as well decompile the client, find the key, use it afterwards. Again, of course you can also decompile a closed source client, but when it's open source, it's a lot easier. Further more the key could be generated by a hash of the size of the client so that if the client was modified the key would no longer work. This way You could review the client if there were no cheats built you could create a key they could then add the key. Checking with the executable size is totally useless, because the information has necessarily to be sent by the client. server has no way to know if the client isn't liing.

I know many of you have said that when starting out all a person really needs is a text editor, so I've been using a text editor to write my code. Then I test it by adding a line the bottom of my code to make Python prompt me for the quit command: this way I can inspect the screen with the Jaws cursor. thanks to the people who suggested that work - around. But I'm really feeling bogged down by the process. I have installed Visual Studio 2013, Community Edition. I've downloaded installed the latest version of Python Tools. All of this was done with the hope that there might be some features VS that could help me check my work more efficiently. I'm running Windows 7 with Jaws 16, latest updates. I am using a refreshable braille display to check my code along with speech. I have tried EdSharp but have found that the indentation it is supposed to support with using the tab key makes Python return all sorts of errors, so I've stopped using EdSharp. I really don't thing continuing to work just a text editor is a realistic option for me, since I have to get assignments done still have time to do things like go to the grocery store, wash my dishes, oh, yeah, have some free time.

 ', I\'m not experienced with Python or with but both have their fair share of mentions subject lines so I imagine there are issues as there are with just about anything. I would suggest googling for an "" accessible python ide "". Naturally an IDE is likely to be workable with many languages but if you can find one which does what you need then all the better. I do most of my coding Java use Sodbeans which I enjoy using though Eclipse is the other big application. I wondere if Python can be coded on either as this is likely to save you time effort with compilation errors being shown with descriptions of the errors, code - completion ( though some might think this a bit naughty, it is still helpful when you get stuck ). Sadly I\'m not up to speed with what can be done with each but I am pretty sure that Python is possible with both Sodbeans Eclipse.'
 ""Thanks. I only wish I had the option of choosing which language to learn with. But the course is taught with Python! I've looked around online for info about an accessible Python IDE found nothing for Python. Someone suggested the PythonVis list, but it seems fairly quiet?

Sorry to sound grumpy: I'm feeling very frustrated by not being able to just do the work like my sighted peers, I am not sure I can stick with all of this if I can't find less demanding ways of learning doing.""

 'amanda, In the edsharp settings you can set the tab key to insert four spaces, instead of the tab character. This will help a bit, I think. with that said, the best editor most accessible my opinion, is emacspeak.

 'Hi, I took my python course 2 years ago had to go through the same issues of finding an accessible IDE that allowed for good streamlining between coding, jumping between methods classes or comments, debugging. This year I ’ m taking an advanced software engineering course using java had to go through similar issues especially with the large asset dependencies involved. I installed eclipse with a plugin called eclim which is a vim editor within eclipse itself. By installing the pydev tools through eclipse ’ s software install, I actually got a full working set which gives me the following: - file explorer to navigate through my classes - declaration explorer which allows me to quickly sift through my variables methods press enter to get to that line - debug console - the vim editor which my opinion is the best I have come across so far though it has a steeper learning curve than other editors. Another note about vim, it is originally a unix / linux command line tool, I believe you will have to start playing with unix / linux systems some point, vim is preinstalled, meaning that you can quickly go to ssh on various systems open vim right there, also using your own. vimrc file which is a config file with your shortcuts macros. one thing is taht I use eclipse on the mac.

 ""Hi, What, exactly, is slowing you down, though? What information are you not getting or able to access that would make your life easier? If we knew that, we could suggest some solutions. You're understandably frustrated the moment, but take a deep breath try to pinpoint what it is that's causing the problem.: the command prompt, it would take you no time all to learn the basics that you would need to know to run Python programs. solution that you're currently using, i. e. getting Python to prompt you, is all very well good until the program you've written encounters a problem exits without running the last line which prompts for input. Also, the future, when you write programs which are more than single - files with linear code flow, you will need to be able to run them monitor their output for errors tracebacks. Currently, if your code does print a traceback, which is Python's way of displaying error information, you won't see it. For this example, let's assume you keep all your Python projects a folder C: \\ python. When you sit down to start coding, open up a Command Prompt window by pressing Windows+R, typing cmd pressing enter. Next, use the cd command, which stands for change directory, to place focus your Python folder: cd C: \\ python Now, let's assume you've just worked on a file called exercise10. py Notepad++, Notepad2 or similar. Hit Ctrl+S, Alt+Tab to your Command Prompt type: python exercise10. py Then press enter. This will invoke the Python Interpreter tell it to read code from the file you've just saved. If your program has errors, you'll see the traceback information you can Alt+Tab back to your text editor, make the necessary changes, re - save the file, Alt+Tab back to the Command Prompt as Tylor described, press the up arrow key, then enter to run the previous command which this case will be: python exercise10. py Unless you've ran any other commands the meantime. If you have, up down arrow will cycle through your command history. If, when running Python, you see the following message: ' python ' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. You'll need to type: setx PATH % PATH %; C: \\ python27; C: \\ python27 \\ scripts This will only be needed once to tell your system where Python is stored. If you're using Python 3. 4, use C: \\ python34 C: \\ python34 \\ scripts instead. all that helps. Really, making these changes to your workflow will not take you long; you'll adjust with ease hopefully find that it makes your life easier. I can't imagine how you've managed to code Python up to this point without being able to read tracebacks. - -""

 ""Wow! First, a huge thanks to all of you for emailing so much advice being so ready to help! This is my first programming class. major, if I stick with it of all these sorts of challenges, will require more programming the future. class I'm taking is working Python only Python. I do not get to decide which language I am learning. There is another month left this course. We are halfway through the course now. It is an eight - week - long course, or half a semester. An entire semester's worth of material is being taught hopefully learned within half the time. I am never taking an eight - week - long course again! LOL We are now past the very basics like strings, variables, importing math random. We are starting to work with pygame. I think snippets would be great, if I knew what sorts of things I would be using often. There are new assignments every day. They are usually due by 11: 59 PM. A lot of the work is done teams, we submit our assignments as a team to all get the same grade for it. I am struggling to stay caught up because getting behind isn't an option, since I can't / don't want to let people down. I can't tell you what I will need to be able to do because I have never programmed before. I have never done any programming before. I know that sighted people working the interpreter get to see their work action, or see exactly what errors they've made where they are. I'm struggling so much with all aspects of the whole learning process as I've been trying to do it that I don't know exactly what specific things are slowing me down. I think maybe a better way of describing what I'm trying to find is to say that I would like to know if there is accessible, easy - to - learn software that will enable me to concentrate on learning Python without having to spend hours on very basic assignments. Is there something that will give me helpful, realtime feedback about the code I am entering? Is there software that is easy to learn? Is there such a thing as a straightforward, everyday - language website discussing accessible programming stuff? I am unfortunately not a position to join the Pythons classes. Other resources like non - visual development are helpful up to a point, but I eventually wind up feeling like I would get a lot more out of them if I already knew about programming. In all sincerity, I am truly awe of all of you for having gotten as far as you having with programming the like, considering what I have been learning about how many accessibility challenges there are when trying to learn all of this.

 ""Conditional statements can be broken down as follows: WHILE is best used while a condition persists. While for example or while I remain hungry. FOR.. NEXT is a loop used when you know exactly how many iterations you require, for example for years = 1 to ten. You don't have to increment a counter then check it's value before returning to the loop or dropping out. If ElseIf are really about the same, can also be used for looping but not very pretty. You often do see ladders of IF / ELSEIF but if a language permits CASE statements where you branch based on particular cases it is much better looking intuitive A few languages have DO.. UNTIL loops, I like them because they test the condition the bottom of the loop where I think it makes more sense than the While. A DO UNTIL loop guarantees the loop is executed least once where the WHILE is tested the top need not execute depending on the condition. Bearing these mind will help you select which loops are most appropriate to the task. code I have read the past very often tells me the author hadn't grasped those concepts.

 ""There's nothing wrong with a forum, but email is just hella convenient. I have to look my email every day regardless, I can process 3 - 5 hundred messages half an hour. Considering I spend 2. 5 hours a day riding a bus, that's not unreasonable. I get very efficient search, filter, threading, accessible spell check, copy paste intergration with something I already have to do every day regardless. In all honesty, there's usually very little I can do to help some one on this list. I am far more reliant on this group than others. If it were a forum though, I would never check it unless I needed something. I would miss things never even know what to search for a forum or even that they were available to look for. Being an email list just keeps me on top of it a much more meaningful way.""
 ""Hi, For me, lists are convenient for the following reasons: 1. centralized stream - I don't have to have fifteen logins for different forums to visit them one by one to check what's new. 2. volume control - some lists I receive as daily summaries can just run over the topics visit only the promising. 3. searchability - GMail has excellent search I can run through large volume of information to find what I need even from the far past. 4. filtering - I can filter threads topics ( via keywords ) if I'm so inclined thanks to mail filtering rules. 5. standartization - e - mail is old known. E - mail clients are solid software that are guaranteed to have support the future. 6. style - e - mails predispose people toward infrequent sending, thought out responses, keeping to the point. Not always, but more often than forums that I've seen. Honestly, number one is the most important. way I consume information, streamlined delivery let's me check everything I follow the fastest possible way. However, if you want to experiment with a forum, check lobste. rs. They seem to me as a good example for community building, you can just clone their code adapt it for your needs. I insist on the mail subscription though.""
 ""I agree with everyone else who has replied - - I'm more likely to reply to something if I can just do it from my email client, which I'll have open anyhow, rather than having to sign into a web site click a bunch of links order to find the post that I want to reply to. I'd want to be notified that there are new posts or replies; otherwise I might not log into the site to check the forum. Maybe some of the forums out there do offer this - - I don't necessarily know a lot about what is current. A few years ago, I was part of a group that was using threadable, which iirc gave the option of interacting either by email or over the web. But their web site now states that signups are closed. Anyway, regardless of what I personally want or don't want, I would say that you are welcome to start a group somewhere see if people join it.""
 ""Well thanks for your honest ( quick ) answers. You guys make very valid points, I kinda get it. I guess if you never clean up your emails, it would be pretty awesome to have this humongous repository of all things accessible tools tips for devs. That's awesome. And I guess Gmail is a good place for it, cuz I don't think they have any size limits. Maybe this Gmail is can become my lists address.: D But all joking aside, I'm glad you got where I was coming from here. It's interesting cuz it's not just program - I. I'm on Raspberry - VI, I frequently see e - mails from people looking for more lists. I kind of want to join that blind Linux one now.: )""
 ""Gmail has limits but if you are not sending image attachments, you'll never reach them. It takes years to reach 1gb with plain text so any other email provider will do as well. If you have issue with the limits, download your past archive, keep it only as local copy. an email client that can search local only use the inbox to the minimum.""
 'Basically email gives me the formate to be productive able to process hundreds. Now if I could get that kind of proformence from a form yahoo. However, there con is to much trash like resumes, status, other statics not needed. All I want is the question however many answers goes with it. Forms just can ’ t do it. M'
 'Basically, forums are pretty awful to navigate quickly. I mean, some email clients make using threads with screen readers a pain, but least on the I can just stop interacting with the current message, just move forward once to go to the next message, something like that, it ’ s such muscle memory now that I don ’ t exactly know how much I uninteract with items, but I know I can just move right with VoiceOver to go to the next message a thread. Reddit would be great, if an accessible site or app for desktop could be made, there are plenty of subreddits about programming, tech, one for blindness. But Reddit ’ s site is pretty awful to use with a screen reader, unless you are one of the blind people with limitless patience, so I don ’ t use it on PC.'
 ', Email is familiar a reliable interface. What it sounds like to me is you need to work on email efficiency a bit. What I mean is my case I use Gmail to receive email, but any email including Exchange can do this. And I have filtering rules set up so each list goes into a folder, or what Gmail calls Labels. Gmail labels turn into folders my Outlook client. Then I can just keep an eye on the lists I am interested either on a daily, weekly or basically never basis unless I need something. I ’ d not want all my lists ending up one Inbox folder. So if that is your current setup I feel your pain. But know there are tools to filter sort make life a lot easier.'
 'That\'s a really good point. I use Gmail, but they keep messing with the interface, what used to be nice neat easy to use is now a mess of "" conversations "" unread goes first regardless of what group it used to be... yeah, email efficiency went out the window a year or so ago.: D But seriously though, I appreciate the suggestion. I can get a different email client not have to use their crappy web interface, that would absolutely help with the issues that keep me wishing all these lists were forums. I use Thunderbird for a different e - mail, so maybe I should set it up to handle my Gmail too.: )'
 'If you use Gmail with the standard interface use the keyboard commands build into Gmail which you must enable for some reason … It becomes the best email interface which Windows has to offer, especially when dealing with threads.']"

 'I find that strategy works well for users also for development environments with sufficient structure to allow branches for releases, fixes, experimentation. I\'ve seen several large projects make a new branch for each major revision change, tags for each minor revision that is actually released, sometimes offshoot branches for special cases like bug fixes security patches. However, a lot of so - called one - man operations like myself don\'t always spend the time energy to create separate branches for each case. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don\'t. result of not doing this is that the concepts of "" major "" "" minor "" tend to blur to the point that choosing which number a revision code to increment becomes rather arbitrary subjective. Of course, I am more explaining the problem than defending the development strategy; but the one defense I will offer is that a multi - branch approach is sometimes overkill when there\'s only one developer involved the product is neither mission - critical nor extremely complex nature. That said though, I have sometimes wished, after the fact, that I had structured a particular project more carefully. Hindsight is the one form of vision I never did lose. two cents of course.'

Was that version 1. 06 or 1. 6? 1. 6. 7 or 1. 7. 6? I highlight the release date as well as the two - part version number so that someone who tries the program can readily get a sense of how recently it was released, whether it may be worth checking for a more current version if significant time has passed.

You might find they become a little more helpful when you tell them that you have been made a better offer elsewhere!! Anyway, here\'s \'s email: Hi All. I\'m hoping to share the knowledge so if you have no interest what so ever UML modelling delete disregard this post. as you may know if you\'ve been reading some of my posts on this list I\'ve been playing around with different design tools with the overall aim of being able to create UML models diagrams for the software I write. As a guide, I have very little useful vision so need to use speech Braille to access any tools. For the last few years I\'ve seen a shift towards modelling software, particularly large OO software, from generally a textual format to a UML diagrammatic form mat. As I am employed by a company who create large scale military software I need to be able to access more importantly draw these diagrams. I think I may have come up with a partial solution. It should be noted here that I\'m no UML Expert the EA tool which I\'ve found to be largely accessible I\'m still a beginner with. One of the UML modelling tools that my company have been playing with is a bit of kit called Enterprise Architect. it\'s a pretty nice bit of software as far as I can tell completely UML1. 4 compliant mostly compliant with the proposed UML 2 spec. after a little modification of the Supernova maps so SN could read the menu bars I\'m now able to create, modify read class, state, object, communication, activity collaboration diagrams. EA has an accessible keyboard interface, or mostly, because of it\'s high use of the project explorer window it\'s pretty easy to navigate. Granted it\'s not as easy to navigate as something like word but remember that this is inherently a graphics creation package. I do have to go to virtual focus which is SN\'s equivalent of the jaws curser but as I\'ve said I can now create a hole host of UML diagrams independently. One great feature of EA is the auto layout diagram function. this does exactly what it says on the tin does it pretty well as far as I can tell from feedback from the guys i work with. It did take me a little while to get to the ideas of how it works but persistence is the key for this one. Once you get the overall your head it\'s pretty easy to do nearly anything this modelling tool. I\'m pretty much going to leave it that but if UML is something you need to do check out EA some one finds this useful.. Software General Dynamics LTD'
 ""Thanks! I think I will have to investigate this one. I think is still on list here too. I can't seem to find a download to demo it.""
 'oh BTW found this pen that is offered on various accessibility related websites that once it dries it raises up so you could trace a diagram feel it. We are going to try this out my job. You can read more about it this website:'
 ""a word of caution. UML diagrams can be pretty complicated detailed. I suspect it won't be possible for you to glean this level of detail by feeling these diagrams, much as though I'd like you to prove me wrong!! For box line diagrams maybe, but I suspect UML is taking it a little too far. I'm just concerned that if your work are supporting you that you have proposed this as a solution it is more likely that it will actually confirm their expectations help them prove their point that you can't do it. At least they're prepared to try though so credit where credit's due. luck anyway.""
 ""Hi, I would also add that by definition, a pen requires the assistance of a sighted person to reproduce the diagram. Although this is not uncommon practice, the area of having sighted readers etc, I've always worked on the principle that if I need someone else to do something for me, then someone else might as well do the whole job. It's cheaper more efficient. Naturally, that defeats the object of proving our point, that we can do these tasks ourselves. Therefore, I think it most definitely the interests of the visually impaired programming community to find, if necessary develop, a means of working with these representations. If there is an XML format which UML diagrams can be saved, then it should be a matter of effort alone to develop an application that will allow a visually impaired person to navigate such a diagram. I'm sure has all kinds of interesting ideas on ways of achieving this, but even a simple text - based interpretation navigation system should be achievable by the folks on this list. E. g. the system could bring up an edit area, similar to a text editor, which displays simplified pictographic representations of the UML structures. By providing keyboard support, the blind user can move around the diagram, be told what the item is, be able to learn what its relationship with associated items is, as well as other useful properties information. One could then be able to load a diagram, display it on the screen, talk or work through it with a sighted colleague, a way that is comfortable to both. Does this sound like a worthwhile project to anyone?""
 ""Hi, I do plan to mention this to them the next meeting. I. E this is more less for box / circle type diagrams. I think they are more less focusing on database diagrams showing how to model tables, the relationships between tables, perhaps some component diagrams. I'm not quite certain what more they model. I have bookmarked EA so I can show them that tool as a possible solution as well. If you have any other ideas on how to transfer a diagram to my mind via any means let me know. comprehension skills are above average because they have to be. I could see prior to losing my sight so that helps a lot. Not saying a person born blind cannot comprehend as well, fact I have two friends born blind that have better comprehension skill than me. I also explained that I can comprehend quite a bit just by discussion. manager I was talking to agreed so I'm hoping this will be the start of people getting me more actively involved the development process.

For example, imagine a really simplistic example for the first three levels of an application - graphically you\'d have a box for each element of the application with lines leading down to the next level of decomposition, thus: Top=Application Application \\ Display "" Busy "" screen Application \\ Process salary payment ( * ) Application \\ Process salary payment \\ Tax exempt ( O ) Application \\ Process salary payment \\ Calculate tax ( O ) Application \\ Display "" Finished "" screen ( * ) = this element is an iteration ( O ) = This element is a selection from top to bottom within the same "" directory "" level is equivalent to reading left to right across that level of the diagram. Obviously, this gets clumsy for very tall structures, but I got around this by splitting boxes out treating them as a new root element. After all, this is what decomposition is meant to achieve. I always meant to create an app that could read my directory files generate graphical output for my colleagues, but never got around to it ( hey, they never got around to writing an app that converted their diagrams into my text structures ). I\'ve used similar ideas with DB diagrams I always seemed to get by. an idea to throw into the pot.'
 'Hi. thanks for the input. So if we were using a database diagram, for example, with tables connected via lines pretty much all of the place, how would you suggest to model this top down? For example, would you start with a certain number of tables interjoined do a top down approach, for example, on three tables. Then after that somehow model the rest of the diagram top down? Also, how would you denote foreign keys relationships between tables using a top down approach? looking for ideas. Thanks!'
 ""Hi, There was a system under development called TDub that did some of what you suggest. It didn't allow for the creation of a diagram, but the version I demoed did allow for the review. It showed the diagram a treeview type format. Sadly I have not heard any more about that project I am not finding it with a google search tonight.

 'yes but it would have to be a sighted blind effort so all could construct it get out what they need etc. we would need sighted programmers to help blind coders working together to produce it IMO.'
 'Agreed that it would benefit from sighted input, order to make sure the UI was usable by them as well. One could quite easily break the project into two parts: the UI the data manipulation. Obviously more thought is required, but it seems to be one of those ideas that ought to get development time., voluntary projects always seem to be the hardest to get off the ground eh?'
 'yes they are. if there are any sighted coders on list that would want to pitch on this please feel free to chirp up. Maybe we can make it an open source effort on some open source large followed web site, such as sourceforge. net, for others to join as well. What do you all think?'
 ""Does anybody know the location of a useful XMI schema document? I've looked the W3C OMG web sites, but they're starting way too low level for my liking. If there's a standard XMI schema used by many UML tools, it could be picked up imported into a. NET project to begin processing XMI files.""

 ""Hi, No, but I know that Visio is capable of producing output SVG. I happen to know someone who has, all be it an experimental, translation unit for converting SVG into textual descriptions, although it's currently undergoing some modifications to retrofit logic based AI to it. Alternatively, Visio has an extensibility model all the information regarding the shapes a Visio diagram are stored the Visio Shape Sheet.""
 ""Hi, Is SVG an XML format? If not, it doesn't really address the question. It seems that XMI is a common format for UML diagramming tools, I thought it best to pick the one that was most commonly used. There are others, such as UXF the like, but they generally seem to be variations on XMI. Since the W3C has definitions for XMI, I also thought it best to adopt as a standard. I've tried playing with the automation library of Visio 2002, but it is not designed for accessibility purposes. There is nothing the object library to tell you the current focus, without having to actually select the item. For navigation purposes, that's pretty unhelpful. Anyway, if someone does know of a published XSD file for an XMI format UML file, please pass it on.""
 ""Hi, SVG is a web diagram format based on XML, can therefore be read by the common XML parsing libraries. There's desire within the W3C, least the WAI, to make SVG accessible. This has started with 1. 1, which contains some semantic content, but will go further with 1. 2, currently working draft stage, with the ability to embed semantic content the major shape elements that have the capability to convey semantic content. AS SVG is an XML based - up it's relatively easy to perform graphical analysis to convert from raw diagram data, such as lines, into semantic content. To some extent I agree about Visio. There is no built - accessibility, largely due to the misperception spread by access technology vendors that blind people cannot use diagrams. I say this is a misperception because diagrams just convey semantic information, but the access technology, through flaws it's conceptual design, isn't able to access that semantic information. However, using the SDK it should be possible to build a keyboard interface to the diagram surface. All the tools are there to do it, via the shapesheet the semantic content can be handed to the access technology a form that it can work with.""
 ""Hi, How many UML diagramming products use SVG format? If it's only Visio, then I think we're probably better off going for a more widely accepted one.""

 'Hi. We use a formal software development methodology here based on a couple of defence standards RUP. I think following something like this would be a bit overkill but you could do the following which is basically the formal methods condensed with all the rubbish removed. This all depends on how formal you want to get. If you want to be auditable you can be or you could just use the document described below as just a guide. I would have your specification document two parts. first part would be a set of software requirements. Something like: software shall enable users to use the standard windows clipboard to copy paste sections of the document. Or. software shall incorporate functionality to automatically save changes to the data. These requirements would probably be some sort of table with potentially the following data. ID: A unique number to Identify the requirement. This is useful bug tracking documentation. Often we use the short name of the software then a number from 1. Something like SDIC _ 1 for a software package called sdic. Requirement Text: This would be the text of the requirement as shown above. You can have all sorts of requirements from major sections of functionality to performance requirements to look feel type requirements. Writing requirements is a bit of an art form use of standard terminology should be fully understood by all parties. This requirement should be written so it\'s testable to prove that the software has met that requirement. Something that says "" the software should look like Microsoft word "" is not clear enough. How can you test something like that, In this case you would have to specify exactly which bits of word should it look like, tool bars, menus so on. Priority Level: This should be a value of either, Medium, or. If being formal priority requirements must be met or the software will not be accepted. Medium requirements can not be met only on sign off from the requirements owner, ( that\'s you ), priority requirements are more there to give a feel of how the software should behave, They are not used much. Test method: final column should tell the software engineers how you want them to prove you\'ve met the requirement. For example, the save requirement from above this could read something like: "" the outputted file will be compared from before after the safe functionality to ensure the changes have been included the file.. This isn\'t formal speak. second part of the document is a freeform text which describes how you expect the software to be used. For an example, for a simple text editor you could say something like this: "" user wants an application which they can enter plain text to, be able to copy paste text, Open save print documents written the editor be able to spell check there work. "" You don\'t perform tests to ensure you\'ve met this text, That\'s what the requirements are for. This basically is used to give the software designers engineers the high level overview of the software. It maybe that some requirements duplicate some of the text this section. This should is OK but generally this section is much less formal. It can take the form of a use case. Once written the software team yourself should review the document should make sure both sides are happy with the requirements how they are to be achieved. At that point the document is base lined any future requirement changes from the end customer should be incorporated only when both you the software team are happy with the changes your going to make. Once the software has been written part of the testing should be a sit - down with the testers to ensure that each of the requirements has been met. This can be as formal or as informal as you like. There are other systems out there which will work just as well as this one but it\'s the sort of thing that we do here. this helps..'

NET 2003, use 7. 1 before starting VS2005. Not a pleasant or neat option, I know.""

 ""Hi, I'm curious whether the JAWS 7. 1 scripts for VS2003 work with JAWS 7. 0. If you're not able to test this though, I understand.""
 'thanks david, I will keep this mind.'
 'Hi, the entry was only my user confignames. ini file, I commented it out, vs 2003 scripts are loaded for both versions of visual studio now. I. E vs 2005 ones are not being loaded.'
 ', I have came up with a way to switch scripts it is 99 % there. I need some help figuring out why the scripts are not successfully loaded by jaws. I created a function to test the date of the vs executable file, specifically only the year. vs 2003 year is 2003 on the file vs 2005 year is 2005 on the file. In the autoload event your 2005 scripts I have: if GetVisualStudioVersion ( ) == 2003 then SwitchToScriptFile ( "" msenv. jsb "", "" msenv. jsb "" ) SwitchToConfiguration ( "" msenv "" ) Return EndIf GetVisualStudioVersion function is this: Int Function GetVisualStudioVersion ( ) var int iDate, string sDate, string sYear let iDate = GetFileDate ( GetAppFilePath ( ) ) let sDate = IntToString ( iDate ) let sYear = stringChopRight ( sDate, 4 ) return StringToInt ( sYear ) EndFunction Certainly there are more eloquent ways of getting the file date / year but this is working. problem is that jaws is * not * successfully loading the vs 2003 msenv. jsb scripts. When I press insert _ +q while vs 2003 it says default settings are loaded. So, it is passing the test for GetVisualStudioVersion ( ), it is 2003, it does try to load the msenv. jsb file, but it is not successful it. Do you have any ideas as to why> this is failing? This should work if we can get the msenv. jsb file to successfully load since the test is valid / works for 2003 2005. I noticed that the SwitchToScriptFile does not have a return to indicate success / failure.'
 'After another cup of coffee I fixed it! * thumbs up * it is working., you will want to follow these instructions. I have the scripts loading under jaws 7. 0 perfectly between vs 2003 vs 2005. test needs to be performed the visual studio 2003 scripts not the visual studio 2005 scripts. I. E the reverse logic of what I was previously doing. Here is how to configure this it is not difficult. 1. make sure jaws 7. 0 is loaded / running 2. Start visual studio 2003 3. press insert+v 4. select script manager press enter. script set for vs 2003 will open. You have to put an if test the first part of the autostart event as follows: Void Function AutoStartEvent ( ) if GetVisualStudioVersion ( ) == 2005 then SwitchToScriptFile ( "" msenv2005. jsb "", "" "" ) SwitchToConfiguration ( "" msenv2005 "" ) return EndIf let giPriorIndent = 0 let gSayAll = false;...... EndFunction Next, copy / paste the below function to the bottom of the vs 2003 script file then press control+s to save / compile. Int Function GetVisualStudioVersion ( ) var int iDate, string sDate, string sYear let iDate = GetFileDate ( GetAppFilePath ( ) ) let sDate = IntToString ( iDate ) let sYear = stringChopRight ( sDate, 4 ) return StringToInt ( sYear ) EndFunction you may not need to perform this last step but may if you have used the self installer for the vs 2005 scripts. Lastly, the ConfigNames. ini file, located... Documents Settings \\ YourName \\ applicationData \\ FreedomScientific \\ Jaws \\ 7. 0 \\ settings \\ enu or.... Documents Settings \\ AllUsers \\ applicationData \\ FreedomScientific \\ Jaws \\ 7. 0 any references to this line the ConfigNames. ini file delete then press control+s to save the change: msenv=msenv2005 Note: that line on my end was always the last line the ConfigNames. ini file. This is it. Now vs 2003 vs 2005 scripts will work perfectly under jaws 7. 0. Note: if you uninstall jaws or install jaws on a new you will need to add the if test again to the AutoStart event also the GetVisualStudioVersion ( ) function so perhaps back them up since they are not part of the default scripts installed with jaws., please remove the ConfigNames. ini file from your self installer or least the line: msenv=msenv2005 since it is not needed. thanks.'
 ""Hi, To be brutally honest, I wouldn't * want * to test the JAWS 7. 1 scripts for VS. NET 2003 JAWS 7. 0. AS I mentioned, the 7. 1 scripts are broken, so are best avoided.""

 'Hi again, I have a more reliable way of testing for vs 2003 vs 2005. It is less code uses the jaws built function GetProgramVersion ( ) which returns the major version of the application. vs 2003 is 7 vs 2005 is 8. You now only need to add one single if test to the first part of the AutoStart event the vs 2003 scripts as follows: Void Function AutoStartEvent ( ) if GetProgramVersion ( GetAppFilePath ( ) ) == 8 then SwitchToScriptFile ( "" msenv2005. jsb "", "" "" ) SwitchToConfiguration ( "" msenv2005 "" ) return EndIf...

Since there were quite a few threads recently about Jupyter accessibility, I thought you guys might be interested it. Download link is included below. This add - on adds a new keystroke NVDA+E browse mode. You need to navigate to a cell you'd like to edit press NVDA+E. add - on will then get the text from that cell open a fully accessible edit window, where you can view or edit the text. Once you're done, you can press either Escape to just update the text the cell, or press Control+Enter, or Shift+Enter, or Alt+Enter to execute the cell. If you're curious how it works, the add - on actually sends Control+A Control+C keystrokes to copy text out of that edit box to show it accessible window. Once you're done editing it pastes your text back using Control+V keystroke. This way tends to work most of the time, but since it is a hacky approach, it is not 100 % reliable. But I have been testing it myself work for a couple of weeks, I can say with confidence that it improves experience with Jupyter a lot. By the way it also works with all other edit boxes inside browsers - e. g. it doesn't have to be Jupyter. There are many other websites on the internet that are using edit boxes, that are not very accessible this add - on might be able to make them more accessible as well. This is a part of my BrowserNav add - on. Make sure to download a recent version ( v1. 10 ), as the previous versions don't include Jupyter accessibility functionality. Download:""

 ""Hi, I am also very interested this subject, I'll try to summarize what I've learned. Feel free to ask for details about a particular subject. synthesis is, indeed, generating speech based only on maths. eSpeak uses multiple synthesis methods, uses some sounds for unvoiced consonants such as t, s etc. For vowels, it uses numbers only. you can actually modify them if you look up the format which phonemes are written. I have developed a program which is able to read modify eSpeak phoneme data for my bachelor, I can send it to you if you want. SpeechPlayer is an example of an open source klatt synthesizer with no voice recordings. is based on the source filter theory: a sound is produced then it gets through diffferent filters which modify it, transforming it into a phoneme, which is an academic way of saying a speech sound. To try it live, open this webpage: modifying the f1 - f3 values see how the vowel changes. For another klatt implementation, more simple than speech player, perhaps, you can try pyklatt: dectalk are both klatt synthesizers, very popular among us, that's why my research concentrated on them. There aare also natural ones, based on speech units. A relatively interesting variety is hmm synthesis, which uses statistical methods to extract data from natural speech. RHVoice is a prominent example, but it is very badly documented. Without a strong background hidden markov models, I wasn't able to understand too much. hth""
 ""Hi, I'm too very interested creating my own TTS engine like eloquence. But didn't tried due to all sorts of very deep technical details. I really wonder that despite eloquence being a clat based synth, how does it sound so good, clear, responsive natural. Have you tried creating your clat based TTS? I certainly would be happy to receive any guidance / help from you.""
 ""HI, No, I haven't tried. thing with eloquence is, it was created by linguists which happened to be programmers too, not by programmers who quickly learned some phonology grammar went on to writing a synth. I can't be sure, eloquence is closed source, but I suspect the reason is the smoothness they defined the phonemes with. Like I said yesterday, a phoneme is a speech sound, usually represented by a letter. In klatt synthesis, it is defined by some numeric parameters, of which the most important are the formants ( f1 - f - 6 ), which are the main frequences which the sound is stronger ( it has peaks the spectrum ). In order for the sound to be natural, those parameters are not fixed. they very, starting low values, getting to a maximum, getting back to low values, order too smoothly connect the sounds together. That's what speechplayer doesn't have all, hence the way it sounds, what speech player eSpeak is trying to implement by using the eSpeak phoneme data, only partially succeeding, if you ask me. Writing a klatt synthesizer itself it is not what we should do, we'd be doing what did when he wrote speech player, simply duplicating the klsyn88 code written by, only having more modern beautiful code, maybe. If you're not a digital signal processing guru, you're not going to know how to improve it, if it needs improving all. What we should do is get quality phoneme data, I think that's eloquence does differently, not the klatt engine. problem with this is that it is not a programming task, it's more of a linguist one. You need special programs which can measure the sound over time provide you all the klatt parameter variants. I found one, a brief tutorial about how to use it for speech player would be the following: speech player espeak, you'd need to create a phoneme the eSpeak phoneme format add multiple frames containing the klatt data. Also, it would help if you could see the phonemes spectrum adjust them the ends to make them connect smoothly. I thought this was too daunting of a task given up, but, my opinion, this is what should be done to get a quality klatt synth. Speech player eSpeak is a good base, we should just build on it. hth""
 ""Hi, Thanks a lot bro. Yes, it indeed seems a very daunting task very deeply technical about the language DSP related stuff,. I'll try, but I think that giving the complexity of this task, I won't be able to proceed with this further sadly.: ( I really feel that we surely need a good wonderful TTS like qloquence but don't know that we'll be able to code that or not. Eloquence on android will be completely dead within some years nobody knows it's future for windows devices too. I'm feeling that it is very hard to learn about phonemes all these things, but,... I wish there could be an easy procedure. I'll check with speech player BTW.""]"

I have to print out on the screen variables my stored proc to see values. How do I do that using sql * plus? Thanks.'
 ""Hi. Although you wrote me off list, I'll reply to this on list so others can see where I am coming from possibly help me out. I can compile oracle procedures fine fix errors design time. That isn't a problem. oracle procedure compiles fine design time since the syntax is correct. However, when I execute the stored procedure from code though, runtime, the procedure raises an error related to a variable my oracle procedure. I need to test what that variable is holding runtime during procedure execution through sql * plus if possible. how do you execute a stored procedure to test it runtime from sql * plus. To give you an idea, many on list will know this, Microsoft sql server 2000, you can use query analyzer to execute a stored procedure runtime such as: exec GetAllCustomers 'smith', 1, 'Austin's When you press f5 to run that, it prints the results of that stored procedure to the output window query analyzer for you to read. In addition to this, you can also test what values any variable is / has during runtime by using the print statement your sql server stored procedure such as this: print @ FirstName query analyzer when the stored procedure reaches the statement print @ FirstName runtime it will print that variables value to the output window query analyzer. As you can imagine, this is very helpful debugging stored procedures runtime sql server 2000. So, basically, I am after how to execute a procedure, or a package. procedure, oracle using sql * plus also how to print out variable values during runtime - - actual code execution to the screen using sql * plus to debug. Is this possible? If not, how do oracal db developers test stored procedures debug them runtime not design time? only tools I have that are accessible are sql * plus the oracle. net plug for vs 2003 from oracle. I am betting there is a way somehow via those tools but am to new to oracle to figure it out adn cannot seem to pinpoint it any documentation. Thanks.""
 'Hi, the show errors command on sql plus. I presume you are getting run time errors? show errors works for compile time errors.

 'There is a real problem with this method. problem with this is the client doesn ’ t always know what they want, what you can actually do for them, what is possible. They also don ’ t know all the edge cases. This is where a more agile development system when working with client works best. I don ’ t la single development system when working with clients. But if you don ’ t go back to them test early often you will run down the wrong path get caught painting yourself into a corner you can ’ t get out of without recoding the entire thing. So it is always best to yes start out with either a written or mental idea of what you ’ re going to do. Then you can write a demo set of code. I think it is always important to get started writing something as quickly as possible. You can design either a wireframe like UI or a feature rich API then you can show a demo to the customer. You will find no matter how closely you do what they ask. Once the person sees the first bit there are all kinds of features that are missing. This is even true writing a game. If you don ’ t get users playing with it early. You won ’ t run into problems until it is to late to easily fix them. Now when I say wire frame. I don ’ t mean using one of those stupid apps that make a fully inaccessible UI interface. It doesn ’ t matter if your wire frame is a text interface that asks questions. Or a UI interface that is what the front end will be like but with no back end stub code. Your can be a running question answer set of code that interrogates your wire frame API that does nothing but respond with this will do this or this will do that. Then sit down with the user or clients walk them through it. Talk them through it really listen to how they react what they ask recommend. They are the ones that are going to be stuck with the results. There is a lot more to this but basically design steps make sure you let your users have a say the development.'

This means that I have modified some of the configuration files that are included the repository to let me run tests against the code here under my development environment, etc. In other words, when I now commit changes to the localised repository that runs on one of our servers here, I want to just exclude some of the files from synching from my side. So, I added their paths to the. git / info / exclude file, trying out both / folder / - folder / file folder / - folder / file path patterns, but, while this seems to have worked for some of the files that are new ones I created from scratch myself, it's now ignoring addition of a file that was previously included the repository terms of still noting it as having had changes made to it? So, am I missing something here, or could this relate to the version / form of a git repository we have hosted here, or, is there something like an easier, or more direct way, like using a git command line command to try exclude the local copy of a file from comparison / synching, etc.? this makes sense - thanks for any suggestions, etc.""
 'Hi, have you ever used. gitignore files?'
 'For ignoring certain files, generally you ’ d add it to a. gitignore. But that means it ’ s not the repository all, which is I think not what you ’ re looking for. Generally what people do when they want a configuration file that can be implemented locally, is to have a sample version that ’ s the repository, then a local version that ’ s. gitignore. For example, say you have config. yml. That file would be the repository. But if you want to make local changes, you might create config - local. yml add that to. gitignore. Then the actual application should look for configuration config - local. yml. Or you could even have config. yml. sample as the repository version, then copy it to config. yml locally, which is. gitignore what the application reads from. that makes sense.'
 ""Not really - know what they're there for, but, wouldn't that then the targeted file as excluded from the repository as a whole? As, one of the specific files does need to stay included the repository, but, just want to exclude any local changes I may make to it as such? Or is there a specific form of syntax a local. gitignore file that would specifically it as only being excluded terms of my local context? Thanks""
 'Yes, It will exclude it from the repo. You can do as suggests though. Also, something that you can do is to make the use of the configuration dependent on an environment variable such that: if. environ [ \'dev _ environment\' ] == "" windows "": load one file else: load another file'
 'Hi Maybe what you want here is a git branch. You could have server, linux windows branches for example. Git is a good system for creating merging branches. If you branch from server to create a windows branch, changes made to the windows branch are invisible to the server branch. Merge is the way to transfer content from one branch to another. It might take some time understanding to set things up right for the workflow you have. I hope this helps.'
 "", that's probably the best idea long - term, but, found the following, which seems more or less exactly what am looking for right now. From the following page, it does seem like you can specifically tell git to exclude a local copy of a file using the following command: git update - index - - skip - worktree That's from the following page: < I just need to be sure this won't mess up anything under the repository itself...

 'Seems like a pretty convoluted method, especially if you need to pull down updates. Not sure if you saw my first response but the method I mentioned really is the standard for the projects I ’ ve been on.'
 'Hi, You can have a Git ignore file. In that file, you ’ d list the names of the files you want to keep Git from tracking.'
 "", the issue is just that, for now, partly since this is still a newish form of employment, I am not wanting to suggest too many changes to them as of yet. As, for something like 9 years, just one developer has been more or less working on the whole project, I am meant to take it over from him, but, we're planning to expand the team, maybe expand our focus areas, but, having more than one developer working on this type of thing would mean we'd specifically want to look into that type of thing. However, for now, I suppose I am still trying to convince them I can do the work, which means I will need to work with what is already place terms of minor fixes / tweaks workarounds this specific context?""
 ', these files do need to be tracked, but, not my local versions - know that again refers to forms of branching, but am not comfortable enough with the interface to try that out right now.'
 'Ah, makes sense. It is something I ’ d suggest definitely though. Your solution can work temporarily then. Or here ’ s a slight alternative: Make your local changes, just make sure never to run git add on that file, when you need to pull down remote changes, run: git stash push git pull git stash will stash your local changes allow you to reapply them later with: git stash apply'

NET \\ Framework \\ v4. 0. 30319 Regarding Mono, the cross - platform version of. NET, I was able to install it on Windows after clicking the appropriate graphics with the JAWS cursor ( unfortunately, the download page has accessibility problems ). For anyone interested, the Mono page is found that assemblies created with Microsoft. NET are, indeed, binary compatible with Mono. I was able to run a C # 2. 0 fruit basket program, cs2 _ fruit. exe, with the following syntax: mono. exe cs2 _ fruit. exe In general, a Mono application is run via command - line parameters to the executable file called mono. exe, which on Windows, is installed by default the following directory: C: \\ Program \\ Mono - 2. 6. 4 \\ bin If you add that directory to your Windows search path, you can run mono. exe from any directory. Analagous shortcuts exist for running Mono apps on Linux or the. Unfortunately, the fruit basket program is not nearly as accessible with Mono on Windows compared to Microsoft. NET on Windows. This is because the System. Windows. Forms GUI classes are implemented under the hood, not with native Windows controls that use MSAA, but with wrappers for the GTK+ GUI library, called GTK #. fruit basket program behaves the same way, e. g., reacting to the Add Delete buttons, but accompanying speech is limited use of the JAWS cursor ( or equivalent with another screen reader ) is needed. If the same program is run with Mono for Linux, however, my guess is that the program would be accessible with Orca, because GTK+ is the GUI library of Gnome, which integrates the ATSPI accessibility API. I do not know whether the same program would be accessible with Mono for the VoiceOver. If anyone can try this report back, that would be useful information.'
 ""Hi, I'm not sure why you should feel surprised that you can't build. NET 4. 0 applications with Visual Studio 2008. To the best of my knowledge, you have never been able to target a later version of a full. NET framework with an earlier version of Visual Studio. E. g. you can't build. NET 1. 1 programs with Visual Studio. NET 2002 nor. NET 2. 0 with Visual Studio. NET 2003. You can, of course, reference later assemblies from within an application targeting an earlier framework as long as you are not using features that require integrated support within the IDE. For example, I have written a. NET 2. 0 application which referenced a. NET 3. 0 assembly that was included as a local resource. This did mean that technically it had a. NET 3. 0 prerequisite for the application, even though it was targeting 2. 0. As you doubtless know,. NET 3. 0 3. 5 are special cases anyway, as they are not complete new versions of the. NET framework like 1. 1, 2. 0 4. 0. They were additional frameworks for. NET 2. 0. It seems more like the marketing guys MS decided that it looked better to be releasing new frameworks than just updating an existing one. As far as I'm concerned,. NET 3. 0 was actually 2. 1, 3. 5 was 2. 2 4. 0 is really 3. 0.: - ) Also, testing how accessible your fruit basket program is running under Mono Windows seems slightly superfluous, since you wouldn't expect end users to do that anyway. By definition you would expect them to execute it natively Windows. So I'm personally not that worried by the accessibility issue you reported. I'm more concerned about the web site accessibility issue, which I feel several of us should report to the Mono community. I'm sure they would address it once the problem was explained to them. It would be good to hear about the accessibility of such applications Linux though. It's certainly reassuring to hear that the assemblies are compatible their IL form to avoid the need for rebuilding or reconfiguring. As long as the application hasn't been written to target any operating system specific features then applications should be portable pretty much directly.""
 'VS is so configurable that I thought Microsoft may have built the ability to target a later Framework version, e. g., with an add - or substitution of certain XML files. Technically, it is probably possible for this ability to exist, given that many developers would be pleased to continue using their familiar VS version, it is apparently a deliberate choice by Microsoft not to support this ability. It does makes sense from a commercial standpoint so that new VS sales would be generated. I think the fact that Mono apps are not accessible on Windows is noteworthy because it means that a developer needs to independently test deploy a Microsoft. NET version of an application that uses Mono on Linux the. Momo compatibility with. NET 2. 0 is high, but not seamless, so introducing a different runtime environment is a significant factor. Overall, however, it is pleasing to know that such cross - platform. NET compatibility now exists - - as long as one mainly sticks to the. NET 2. 0 class library. By the way, there is now a VB compiler on Mono as well as a C # one. Also, another cross - platform version of. NET that folks may wish to consider is called Portable. NET, available'

No issue compiling, sound file is there etc, but the sound just won ’ t play. Any idea?'
 'Well, I don ’ t see any problems. I assume that the sound files really do make sounds? One thing that doesn ’ t sound right to me is that you say you don ’ t see the files the navigator. There isn ’ t any supporting files group an IOS project, but I thing you still should see them. And they should be the “ copy bundle resources ” list the build phases tab. Also, you should see them the app itself finder when you do a show package contents. If all of that is true, than I have no idea.

But when I try arrowing down ( or anywhere ) pressing enter, nothing happens. That's where I'm stuck.""
 ""As I said, it is possible. However, secure boot uefi will get your way. You will either have to turn both of them off, which voids any manufacturer support, or use fusion / workstation to virtualize it. Depending on your form factor, you will need to have someone sighted look the bios anyways. If you want to virtualize 64bit software, you need to turn on vt / x code profiling support for vt / x. This is much safer easier than taking a chance with dual boot under secure boot / uefi. scenario you don't want to get into is when you load up linux tell it to dual boot with Windows, just to have it overwrite your secure boot / uefi sectors on your HD delete Windows the process... Take it from experience, it happened to me when secure boot / uefi first came out. You can check, but I don't think most Linux installers have caught up yet since secure boot / uefi is proprietary technology.""]"

She wants to organize the information that her office managed. This office manage the award for the employees of this federal entity. Supervisors managers submit to this office PDF files with the information of employees that they are nominating for an specific award. Some times these PDF has to be return to the senders because the PDF has the information uncomplete or with typing mistakes. Moreover, the location of data on separate PDF files makes extremely difficult for her employees to verify or take the information a organized accurate fashion. So, she knows that I had some experience coding years ago. Additionally, my area of education I know a little bit about quantifiable information that she needs as outcomes from this project. She asked me to develop a system that would let supervisors managers to submit the information with an automized way that will verify that all data on the form is complete accurate. Additionally, she doesn't want anybody copying pasting information from the PDF since there are also a lot of human errors. Lastly, she also wants to get some statistical reports that are the less complex part of this project. What is the problem. I am looking for a way to collect this information a automize way from the supervisors managers directly to a database. During the day I found 3 or 4 possible paths to take. 1. Is Developing an Access database putting it a share folder. However, it might not be the best choice since the number of people accessing the database is unknown. Moreover, it will require some coding, testing I only have 3 months to finish this project. 2. Using Share point using a share point survey form. It will be able to create reports even transfer the data to another platforms. However, I am not sure which are those platforms how accessible it could be. 3. Using Microsoft Excel online forms. This is the ideal choice because, I will be able to create the data reports on excel without mayor problem. However, Microsoft will be taking this software away very soon. 4. Using Microsoft Forms. This is the solution that will replace Microsoft Excel forms it appear to be much better than the previous solution. Nevertheless, Microsoft Forms is not able to transfer the data automatically to an excel file. It will be something that should be done manually. Nevertheless, I have no idea about the accessibility of this platform. She doesn't want to expend a penny, the resources available are very limited. I don't have any development platform or database management platform available. Request it could take weeks time is a scared resource now. Additionally, I might lack experience on those platforms. So, learning is something that also is going to require time testing. If you have any additional idea, or which of these previous options could be the best solution? Thanks to all, 5.""

When you have the requirements set, send your manager a quick email outlining them get a reply agreeing to them before you begin development.'
 'Hi there, Let me share some ideas. They may not solve all your issues but I hope they help. 1. As some have said, I believe Excel is your friend & I don\'t see the need to complicate the matters with Access 2. PDF is your enemy here. sooner you can get your data out of it, the better. I don\'t know how you can convert your data a predictable text format (. csv or with other delimiters ), but to me, that is your biggest problem since from what you say, your input is not controllable. 3. You are right worrying about concurrent access to your data. But actually, Sharepoint might be a good ally this respect. If I\'m not mistaken, if you have, say a spreadsheet, stored on Sharepoint, you can control what kind of access your users will have ( read only or read write ). Furthermore, for those users who have read write access, Sharepoint can handle that that there is a versioning mechanism. If someone needs to change the master spreadsheet, he / she will download it & the document can be "" checked out "" until it\'s updated & "" checked "" again. To summarize, the Sharepoint support person is one of your best ally here. Finally, you may realize that a slight change the whole process may be order & it should be accepted if you conceive it ( & document it ) right. Remember, clarity is of the essence!'
 'Hi I think that your second idea would be the best. You said that you share a template, do you mean a excel file template? If it is the case, after the templates have been filled, how do you collect the information that people has added on those templates? Excel Online Forms is able to add the information added on the forms automatically an excel sheet. However, Microsoft is discontinuing Microsoft Forms online wants to push everybody to use Microsoft Forms. When you said that you have tried Microsoft Forms that it was not successful, do you mean the accessibility or just that the Microsoft Forms was not a good solution for your purpose? Thank you.'
 ""Hi, Yes, we agree that PDF are the enemies. They have been using the PDF files sent by email for ever. This is one of the reasons why the process are so slow. Some times these PDF are going to be missing esensial information, so the sender has to correct the PDF send it again. This duplication of information of files has catrastofic concecuenses to the data realilability. So we want to stop the use of the PDF. We have Share Point I don't think that would be difficult to create an Excel form, add it to Share Point. I guess that the users would be able to add the information on the form this information is going to be saved on the excel sheet. However, I am not sure if I would be able to control how the data is going to be store. I would like to have the data a table of records since we need to create statistical reports. I need to learn more about the Excel Forms. Unfortunately, Microsoft is discontinuing Excel Online forms wants everybody to use Microsoft Forms. Microsoft Forms is not able to add the information on the forms an excel sheet. I think that Microsoft's decision is a step back for users. Also, I haven't talked about accessibility yet. Let us see.

In contrast with Microsoft Forms, Excel Online forms transferred the data from the form automatically to the excel sheet as soon as the submit button has been click or the way we prefer on excel. No body has to go to Microsoft Forms with a couple of clicks transfer the data to excel. However, not knowing how much data or for how long this data is going to be keep the Microsoft Forms, it sounds a little bit ambiguous it might be a problem the future since there would need to be someone keeping an eye on the Microsoft Forms.

Firefox apparently runs on multiple platforms so it should be interesting how it progresses. And most of the programmers on the list may know it is open source that there is an accessibility initiative, although it isn\'t quite accessible yet - - don\'t know how it is progressing. le * * * * * * * Yeah, it\'s all that is said more but most of us who use screen readers will find it not quite what we need a browser. I hope that changes soon. Digital Domain: Is Microsoft\'s Henhouse ( Salivating ) December 19, 2004 By RANDALL STROSS FIREFOX is a classic overnight success, many years the making. Published by the Mozilla Foundation, a nonprofit group supporting open - source software that draws upon the skills of hundreds of volunteer programmers, Firefox is a Web browser that is fast filled with features that Microsoft\'s stodgy Internet lacks. Firefox installs a snap, it\'s free. Firefox 1. 0 was released on Nov. 9. over a month later, the foundation celebrated a remarkable milestone: 10 million downloads. Donations from Firefox\'s appreciative fans paid for a two - page advertisement Times on Thursday. Until now, the Linux operating system was the best - known success among the hundreds of open - source projects that challenge Microsoft with technically strong, free software that improves as the population of bug - reporting bug - fixing users grows. But unless you oversee purchases for a corporate data center, it\'s unlikely that you\'ve felt the need to try Linux yourself. With Firefox, open - source software moves from back - office obscurity to your, to your parents\', too. ( Your children college are already using it. ) It is polished, as easy to use as Internet, most compelling, much better defended against viruses, worms snoops. Microsoft has always viewed Internet \'s tight integration with Windows to be an attractive feature. That, however, was before security became the unmet need of the day. Firefox sits lightly on top of Windows, a separation from the underlying operating system that the Mozilla Foundation\'s president,, calls a "" natural defense. "" For the first time, Internet has been losing market share. According to a worldwide survey conducted late November by OneStat. com, a company Amsterdam that analyzes the Web, Internet \'s share dropped to less than 89 percent, 5 percentage points less than. Firefox now has almost 5 percent of the market, it is growing. Schare, Microsoft\'s director of product management for Windows, has been assigned the unenviable task of explaining how Microsoft plans to respond to the Firefox challenge with a product whose features were last updated three years ago. has said that current users of Internet will stick with it once they take into account "" all the factors that led them to choose I. E. the first place. "" Beg your pardon. Choose? Doesn\'t I. E. come bundled with Windows?. Schare has said that Mozilla\'s Firefox must prove it can smoothly move from version 1. 0 to 2. 0, has thus far enjoyed "" a bit of a free ride. "" If I were the spokesman for the software company that included the company\'s browser free on every Windows PC, I\'d be more careful about using the phrase "" free ride. "" Trying to strike a conciliatory note,. Schare has also declared that he his company were happy to have Firefox as "" part of the large ecosystem "" of software that runs on Windows. In fact, Firefox is ecumenically neutral, being available also for both the for Linux.. Schare may be the official spokesman, but he does not use Internet himself. Instead he uses Maxthon, published by a little company of the same name. It uses the Internet engine but provides loads of features that Internet does not. "" Tabs are what hooked me, "" he told me, referring to the ability to open within a single window many different Web sites move easily among them, rather than open separate windows for each one tax the \'s memory. Firefox has tabs. Other browsers do, too. But fundamental design decisions for Internet prevent the addition of this other desiderata without a thorough update of Windows, which will not be complete until 2006 the earliest. How fitting that Microsoft finds itself this predicament. In late 1995, a time when Netscape Navigator was synonymous with the Web Internet had yet to attract many adopters, Microsoft made a risky but strategically wise decision to redesign the Internet code from the bottom up - re - architecting, industry jargon. As A. of M. I. T. B. Yoffie of chronicled their 1998 book, "" Competing on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape Its With Microsoft, "" that decision meant delaying the release of Internet 3. 0, but the resulting product was technically far superior to Netscape\'s Navigator. In Browser Wars I, the better browser won. Today, it\'s the Internet code that is long overdue for a top - to - bottom redesign, one that would treat security as integral, Firefox is the challenger with new, clean code. Netscape bequeathed its software to the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation, which used an open - source approach to undertake a complete rewrite that took three years. Firefox is built upon the Mozilla base. All Microsoft can offer Internet users are incremental security improvements, new patches to fix holes the old patches. In Windows XP 2, the company claimed as a major security advance a notice that is displayed if the user takes an action within Internet that sets off a download of a tiny application called an ActiveX control, which can take control of your PC, a worst - case instance, erase your hard drive. "" Users still must make informed decisions, "". Schare added. ( With Firefox, users do not have to make decisions about these miniprograms, which are blocked by design. ) Schneier, the chief technical officer of Counterpane Internet Security Inc. an authority on security issues, did not hide his anger Microsoft\'s claim of having improved Internet. "" When my mother gets a prompt \' Do you want to download this? \' she\'s going to say yes "" he said. "" It\'s disingenuous for Microsoft to give you all of these tools with which to hang yourself, when you do, then say it\'s your fault. "" lectures his clients ( his mother ): "" \'t use Microsoft Internet, period. "" has been using the browser Opera, but having tried Firefox declares it "" a great alternative. "" THIS month, officials Pennsylvania State University recommended that students staff stop using Internet because of persistent security problems. announcement said that "" the threats are real, alternatives exist. "" with code from a bygone era when the need for protection against bad guys was little considered, Microsoft cannot do much. It does not offer a new stand - alone version of Internet. Instead, the loyal customer must download install the newest version of 2. That, turn, requires Windows XP. Those who have an earlier version of Windows are out of luck if they wish to stick with Internet.. Schare of Microsoft does have one suggestion for those who cannot use the latest patches 2: buy a new personal. By the same reasoning, the security problems created by a car\'s broken door lock could be solved by buying an entirely new automobile. analogy comes straight from. Schare. "" It\'s like buying a car, "" he said. "" If you want to get the latest safety features, you have to buy the latest model. "" In this case, the very latest model is not a 2001 Internet, but a 2004 Firefox. Stross is a historian author based Silicon'

 'Well, as says, I\'d probably take issue with the phrase "" much better defended against viruses snoops... "" It\'s not defended, but * much * less attacked. If it continues its success, I have no doubt that will change though. And then we\'ll see how quickly people\'s allegiance\'s change.'
 ""Hi - - only security hole I see IE is the ActiveX - - I tend to disable it but even the Windows desktop control panel when I first create a login requires activex to run - - well I may be wront, but I found when I upped the security level internet options, I suddenly couldn't do a bunch of things I was previously able to do Windows XP Pro because of all the ActiveX controls scripts. Of course when I switched to Windows classic desktop it all went away. But with all the security problems with ActiveX I would think M$ would define their own interface not to require it. Caveat: I'm not a guru of windows so my terminology understanding of what I was dealing with may be wrong, but I have heard many people say that windows is full of holes that it can be broken into easily by anyone with a little knowledge of things. But I don't want to deal with that - - just put up a firewall forget about it. Anyway, I'm not flaming IE - - I actually like IE - - it is easy to use has lots of options that are not hard to figure out for themost part. ) Unlike, which is quite convoluted. ) But back to firefox, presumably if it runs on windows it will have to deal with the same security holes, so it should be interesting where it goes. le""
 'Everything below is meant as friendly comment. If it seems a bit dogmatic then I apologise. It is a subject that I feel strongly about. When push comes to shove, ActiveX is only COM. Windows uses COM very extensively. All of explorer is based around it, all database access is based around it. All messaging is based around it. We don\'t have our own internal ways of doing these things because we are not allowed to do that - it would give our products an unfair advantage. Swarms of laywers check what we do. If I so much as have a bug fixed, it will often need to be checked by lawyers to ensure that it doesn\'t use some secret technique. As for security, ActiveX is as secure as COM because they are one the same. With COM ( COM+ which is the same again really ), you can set security for each packet, on connection, on caller\'s rights, on roles on a per method basis a bunch of other ways. That doesn\'t mean that COM has never been used a hack. All the script viruses use COM, normally to manipulate the file system object. email worms used COM to send themselves around. We are a bit of a cleft stick here. People ask us to add functionality to allow programs to control this subsystem or that. We do so. Then people complain that hostile programs control this or that subsystem. To this day, a very common support call is "" Customer: Messaging won\'t allow my app to send emails without warning the user "" "" Tech: Yes Sir. That is to slow down or stop email viruses "" "" Customer: I can see where that is a good idea but I need to do it. How to I programatically disable this security feature? "" "" Tech: I am sorry but you can\'t, Sir "" "" Customer: But I want to "" "" Tech: So do the worm writers, Sir "" So, as you experienced yourself, better security means less functionality. It is all a balancing act. I hear a lot about security holes I have seen some exploits. A lot of people got hit by Code. Perhaps it would be a good idea to explain some of our processes without giving away any secrets. highest priority bugs are security bugs. We deal with them first. Typically, they are found older code because we have very strict rules about reviewing code as it is written for security glitches we have what we call security pushes where old code is reviewed as well as new code. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of code to review - tens if not hundreds of millions of lines of code the code base is always changing as we fix things. That is one of the reasons that we are reluctant to fix harmless bugs - we don\'t want to add risk of a security bug or a regression bug. There is a the end of the tunnel though. As more of the code base moves to manaaged code, it gets harder to hack., there was the GDIPULS hack but generally managed code is safer because you can\'t overrun a buffer it is much trickier to work out just what the CLR is doing. With non - NGENed code, it is even tougher because you don\'t know where the code lives. It was generated by the JITter some point its addres will depend on the order of execution. So yes, security is a problem. It is a problem that we are working on. If we move too quick, we break third party applications - a lot were broken by XP SP2 more won\'t run on Windows Server 2003. I don\'t say that we are doing a good job of this but I don\'t think that we are doing a bad one either I hope that this rant was of interest - apologies if it came over as being a bit strong _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _'
 ""Hi, All software has security holes. I defy anyone to demonstrate software that is impossible to crack some fashion or another. Basically, the only totally secure system is a house brick. You can't get any data into it, you can't get any data out of it. That is totally secure... but utterly useless. reason MS's software is highlighted this way, is purely because it is by far away the most popular, most used. Once, if it happens, Firefox starts to pick up a majority of the user base, then you can rest assured the hackers virus creators will start to target that instead. And finally, no security system that involves people is secure. All it takes is for someone to tell someone else their password, the whole system is wide open to attack. No amount of security design behind - the - scenes filling of holes will stop that kind of breach. IN the same way, any building that has expensive electronic swipe cards keypads is only as secure as the least honest of their employees.""

I have rolled my own approach which involves storing translations on a data medium, a xml file or DataBase object, performing an automatic MS Translation when the project is loaded on a users based on their local CultureInfo settings for the first time. I currently load DataDictionaries with the translations for the UI elements strings after the first translation is performed. Now I want to build something which is more akin to a Professional Level methodology to handle globalization am ReVisiting the options, including my own. In the Microsoft Technicals the user can not modify UI strings since they are compiled but the case of satelite DLLs it is possible to fairly easily update individual Language DLLs without impacting other project resources. In my senario the user can modify the UI strings if they choose to more reflect actual meanings which may be muddled using the Microsoft Translation API. I also am considering having one group of strings for each language the DataBase performing the translations prior to shipping which would allow for just updating the DataBase not allow users to muck about with modifying translations. Again, updating the DataBase would be simple not involve mucking about with ReCompiling anything the users end nor mess with their setup of compiled code data. It seems about as simple, or complx, to implement globalization either the standard MS methods or my own method. I am wondering if anyone has had experience with a World implementation of Globalization has any inputs they may give me so I can decide which would be the best approach going forward. Also, if you have any other ideas via your experience they will help too since this is a fairly esoteric batch of technicals to test debug without help from abroad, especially sighted help the case of formatting calendars. so, that's it. If you work for a company know about Globalization techniques I would appreciate any inputs you have all before I start ReCoding for better performance flexability. Thanks:""
 ""Hi. I've worked on 2 commercial programs which have been translated to different languages 2 different companies. Both used similar methods. Both had a config file, one XML, one was a text file, which identified the string by some sort of identifier, the best one was a message number. Every line of text that could be output was this config file, called a translation table. There was then a header file which had an enumeration which had a list of message names to identifiers to help with code readability. A lookup method was written which took an identifier from the Enum returned the translated string. benefits of doing it this way rather than via a resource script a DLL or compiled to the program is that your program can be translated to new languages with out having to know any information about programming or with out recompilation.""
 'Thanks: That is my general opinion as well. Besides, if a end user doesn\'t like a translation he, or she, can change it if the application enables that feature. I am now working on a helper application to read a vb. net project using Windows, examining the files objects the project automatically generating related "" Translation Tables "" for all the UI strings objects. I think I will keep them a Sql CE Database to be included a project load the appropriate Translation table runtime along with calendar or formatting if necessary based on either a user selected Locale or on the default locale of the \'s thread use. This should take allot of the pain out of the Globalization Process for this old fat blind guy - grin! Oh ya, if I pick up the full Pro Version of Visual Studio I may create an add - to select or add globalized strings while coding a class. I may also do this by creating a helper project to provide accessing the current UI Table Values,, allowing me to add or click one of the existing entries copy the definition key to the clipboard paste it into the vb. net project code I am working. Since I don\'t have the VS Pro version one of the non Add - In models will be my choice for now but should work well enough to get the job done painlessly. Thanks let me know if you think of anything else related to Globalization I may employ to make the process easier, faster or more accurate.'
 ""One thing, even given your concerns about string translations, I would give serious thought to using MS' calendar time formatting support. There are simply enough different possibilities there that it makes sense to leverage the work that MS has done on that front. I also agree that you are going to have to get least some sighted assistance if you are serious about such things, especially as you move away from western European languages. Asian languages especially are a huge pain to render ( I don't speak or read any such languages, I've simply rendered some such text I've found as a test ). Keep mind that the amount of screen area that is sufficient for may well not be enough for other languages, possibly the inverse as well ( though I've never encountered that ). One benefit of using MS style resource dlls is that the user is far less likely to screw up their installation by accident: ) Although I suppose that is true with an sqlite DB as well. If you are doing this. net ( which sounds like the case ), if you don't have very many strings you might also want to simply store them the ( user ) application config file.""

 'Hi Guys: I believe the KISS philosophy as well. This is actually simpler than the existing approaches when considering maintenance upgrades. It also allows me to use the already built - calendar formatting methods properties which I sure wouldn\'t want to mess with considering how little I know about other languages. development process as I envision it so far: Add any messages as named class level variables the top of a form class during module development testing; Build forms with User Controlls as usual the Designer setting text properties the Properties Window; When the module is tested working... Run the helper app which will: the class or form code picking up the class level variables identified for translation, Translate them into the desired languages add them to the DataBase; Generate code necessary to build load a Global Dictionary using these other translations related to the form or class; If a Form the form\'s designer code update the DataBase Global Dictionaries as above; Finally, add code to either the Load Event or the "" "" event of the class to use the translations the Globals Dictionary. Actually a pretty simple process compared to building the satelite DLLs managing them manually if changes occur during the lifetime of the project. I still have to determine how best to dynamically modify the UI element text length ensure I can modify a project from outside the IDE without causing any problems for the build process. Does this sound like a pretty tight conceptual design from a Pro viewpoint? Thanks:'
 ""Hi 1. I would definitely echo 's comments about expansion factors presentation space. There is almost always an expansion factor it does not matter which direction a Source > Target language pair. I have not looked but MS or a translation organization site such as or the site for FIT might have some rough estimates. When I do translations like this, I can also tell you that I frequently have to pay attention to the whole UI so that the right words fall the right places spite of different syntax different languages. 2. Depending on your expected market, it might be worth your time to check with a translation firm for other pointers. Some sites have good basic getting started client education material on their websites; others bundle services different ways but a couple hours of consulting time could save a lot of hassle down the road. 3. I would like to forward your inquiry to a blind interpreters list I am on. A number of people there do more localization than I do might have additional tips.""
 'Thanks for the tips. Go ahead forward the concept. I think I may be able to expand any boxes runtime by changing the length property setting based on a calculated value for the actual translated text length. translations will be auto - generated by the Microsoft Translator API. I know that is very rough but most folks seem to get the general idea from the translations. I may, or not, allow users to modify the translations while the program itself - not sure if I want to do that or have them send me translation changes propagate them myself. I think this design would also allow for using manual translations by just not auto - generating the translation for the language since once a translation is the DB all other operations should remain the same. Also, I like the idea of looking some Websites other Translation software. I do have a Professional translator who has helped me wwith earlier designs where I used an xml file as the DataStore another conceptual model for handling the implementation of the Translations. Thanks for the ideas I will follow up by checking out some existing translation sites software documentation - that may give me some more ideas.'
 ""Keep mind that just increasing the width of a text box may not be enough. many Asian writing systems require much more vertical space ( even when rendered on horizontal lines ). Chinese for instance pretty much requires 24 pixels of vertical space, Japanese needs least 16, where can get away with as little as 7 pixels ( of course looks way better with just a little more but it doesn't take much ). I had never heard of the MS translator API before this, my experience with automated translation is that it does well enough to get the idea across, but if you are actually producing software rather than trying to consume it I would highly recommend that you get a skilled human to do that part of the job. You don't want potential users to look your product get annoyed by some trivial mistake.""
 ""I have learned to be just distrustful enough of translators of any kind except for human beings. Translators will more often than not probably mess up stuff. And it's not just trivial mistakes either. I was translating something a Spanish book once, the automated translator had it backwards!""
 ""Hi all This article from the European Union is slightly Off - topic from 's original inquiry, but it talks some about the process of localization from a translator's perspective. c ago, someone posted here about doing some consultation for international firms, if I remember correctly, about preserving accessibility during internationalization. I meant to try offlist to hook this person up with SDL / TraDOS because a number of blind translators around the world find it extremely vexing that accessibility of TraDOS products comes goes with different software versions. Microsoft for instance does lots of things such as standardizing some aspects of language to streamline localization. I am not enough of an accessibility engineer to comment about why maintaining consistent accessibility seems harder.""
 ""Thanks: I guess I will have to set up something to handle the height as well. That will be more tricky since the default height of most controls seems to be set according to the Font Size. I am using the machine - translator to avoid having to get several Professional Translators involved for smaller projects. For larger projects the app will simpley allow for using manual translations by sending a translator the list of strings, having them translated adding them into the DataBase. same for translation modifications. other choice would be to allow each user to right click any string modify it to something they prefer. I think the former is a better choice since changes can be cumulative applied to all outstanding users using something like a Once approach to upgrade the DataBase. I will have to give some more thought to extending the height of controls the case where non - english languages are used. I will do some poking about to see if I can find out how Microsoft handles this when using their built - localization feature for UI controls. This is the first real problem I have encountered so far with this conceptual design was mentioned by another poster earlier. From the sounds of it some of you are involved larger, multi - personell, projects. For those situations I think a Visual Studio Add - In would be the best approach to use have a Globalization Specialist or the UI Design Specialist managing the Translation process upon request from programmers when modules are ready for translation Translation testing. That way the entire process would be compartmentalized as might be the case a larger, multi - location project. diference there would be the design of the Globalization Platform to allow for communications between the departments, or, using the Visual Studio or other software plug - ins to make it all look like a natural part of the Visual Studio IDE. That is beyond what I am building but what I am building should be able to be extended or used as a conceptual model for building a multi - user platform like that. I do get that it would be good to use actual people to get quality translations where feasible I can do that with this model as well as use machine - translations when a translator is not available. machine - translations can also be cleaned up by a translator just as easily. Yes, I will have to do some research on the problem of modifying any UI element sizes, perhaps, positioning of the elements dynamically. key there would be finding out the required max length height of a string if I can even modify the height of a UI element like a TextBox run - time. other choice would be to go back to using the root assembly version of the Microsoft built - localization Feature since I think it handles all that automatically within each language resource file. Anyway, that is one place where I may be looking to see if the height property is indeed extended. As for RePositioning the elements on the page for allignment, that is possible but I may not worry about that just keep mind the maximum minimum sizes of controls set them to the Maximum size design time. Since things are typically alligned left to right / Top To that will not be a problem. In fact, languages where things are alligned right to left / Top to bottom that should work as well since the justification within a control would also be right to left. This will indeed require some research experimentation to come up with a viable solution. Do other Localization Applications do ReFormatting of forms automatically adjust their controls on the fly or how do they handle this if all? guess is it is handled manually most cases but I'm still reading docs for other systems.""]"

I'm asking because when I read the NVDA contributing documentation, that document wants me to have two repositories on the server, the one I have forked the one from NVDA. When I read about using Git GitHub, they talk about only having my own copy of a project not syncing my local one with the original one, they talk about making changes to my repository on my PC pushing those changes up to my repository, making pull requests on the original. I'm not understanding why I would do it each way what effect each way has, no matter what I try to read. Can someone please help me get this? Thanks.""
 ': regardless of what any documentation might tell you... I believe that what they are trying to tell you is that you should keep or fork your own copy of the code, play around with it, never return or publish or commit code that you are absolutely sure you have tested very well. And even then they will probably only let you publish code a sandbox or separate folder or fork that they will use to test the code again again. Almost all projects using any kind of source code repository technology have this basic principle. Now, depending on the project, some have a fork or branch or separate copy of the code for anything possible: one fork per developer, per, per server, per version.... whatever. There is no single unique best way to use git, it is a tool as such different people use it different ways.'
 'Here\'s what I think you need to know: Unless you are a core - contributer, you ( probably ) don\'t have write access to the primary NVDA repository. Therefore, if you want to make changes to the code, you need your own copy of the NVDA repository that you do have write access to. Forking the NVDA repo gives you exactly that. Once you\'ve made changes to your copy of the repository, you will presumably want them to be merged back into the main NVDA repository. In order to ask the NVDA developers to do that, you will submit a pull request on the main NVDA repository. A pull request basically says: "" I\'ve made some changes my forked copy of the NVDA repository, I\'d like you to merge them back. "" In your pull request, you will specify what repository, which branch that repository, contains your changes. One thing to keep mind, however, is that the code the main NVDA repo is a moving target. It\'s constantly being updated. So, if you don\'t keep your repository up to date with the main repository, it gets less less relevant. After a while, the files that you modified your patch may have been completely reorganized the main repo, the code may look totally different. In short, the more out of date your version of the code becomes, the more work it becomes for the NVDA maintainers to merge your changes. And, since they\'re busy folks, with a limited number of hours the day, you might be waiting a long time, or they may decide it\'s not worth the effort entirely. Finally, to be a little clearer, if you are trying to get a change merged into the master branch, you want there to be as little difference as possible between your branch with the change, the primary master branch. Ideally, the only difference should be the change you made, though since the master branch is being updated so often, that is likely not practical. But the closer it matches, the easier it is for them to merge your changes, often simply by clicking a button. I hope that this helps. luck.'
 'Hi, Should I be reading into this reply that after I pull the latest changes now that my local copy is synched with the NVDA repository that I should push those changes to my forked copy of the NVDA repository? original question was when should I only use my forked repository when working on a project when should I keep my local copy sync with the original instead of my forked copy. Thanks.'
 ""Yes, but it should be a clean merge ( I. E. a fast forward ). Generally, this is why I do all my changes feature branches, so I can leave master, all the branches from the original repo untouched by me, so it's easy to keep my repo sync with the original.""]"

I have no experience with OpenGL have a few questions. Is working with it all accessible with screen readers? If so, do I need to do anything special to make it work? resources I have for this class recommend using a virtual machine for graphics assignments, setting PuTTY up to work with graphics, using MobaXTerm, which was not accessible last time I tried it, or using Visual Studio with the OpenGL packages that are available. I thought about using a virtual machine, but the recommended one for my class is VirtualBox, which doesn't seem to work with NVDA. I was told about a free version of VMWare but couldn't get it to work. Is there another virtual machine program that's accessible free or very low - cost? Are any of these ways of programming with graphics accessible? If so, which ones, what do I need to do to get set up? If none are accessible, I'll request alternative assignments. Please let me know what you think as soon as possible so I can figure this out. Thanks. - - - This email has been checked for viruses by AVG.""
 ""HEllo, I'll approach this as you asked the questions to try to make things easier. First, OpenGL is generally going to be very graphics heavy ( that's the point, it's used to draw graphics ). Incidentally this is the layer for QT which is why it's so tough to make accessible. If you use a virtual machine for graphics assignments, you will not rceive much information all. You can tunnel XWindows over SSH, but that doesn't tell you anything as the rendering will not be accessible. This would also require you edit Linux ( recommend Emacs with Emacspeak here, although there's a learning curve ) or using an editor with something like WinSCP. VMWare Workstation works, but you'll need to install a Linux distro from scratch. easiest out of the box is Ubuntu if you want a GUI, or Debian if you want a console. Others have various other options, but this is the easiest to get up running. Neither of these points answers your questions, but gets more of your indirect questions. To answer your final question, there are many many ways to learn object - oriented programming, they do not have to be graphical. There are many other accessible assignments that don't require the use of OpenGL. downside to this is it's going to be much harder to follow lectures if everyone is rendering all kinds of graphics, but if you follow your textbook ask questions you should do well. From my experience, there are some really important points OO to learn. Your class may not cover all of these, but if you do you'll have a pretty solid understanding. 1. Polymorphism, downcasting upcasting ( use of dynamic _ cast how it works ). 2. Composition vs inheritance, how when to use each. 3. Scope; private, protected, public. 4. Virtual abstract methods.""
 ""Hi. This definitely helps. I'll email my professor the disability services office about alternative assignments. I'm taking the class online, so there are no lectures everything is learned through reading, discussion boards, optional videos. There are a few team activities where not doing what my team is doing could make things difficult, but it shouldn't be too much of a problem. graphics are already drawn for the first few assignments, so I could still possibly do them, but it would be hard to test debug my code, I would prefer not to work on programs that a blind person wouldn't be able to use. Hopefully it won't be too hard to figure out some alternative assignments. Thanks for your help.""

DataGrid control. control itself seems to do pretty well for accessibility, testing against Jaws, NVDA Window - Eyes. ColumnHeader text is announced as you move from column to column, as is the cell\'s data value. Similarly, the data values are announced as you move up / down a column. However, the visual design of one of the application\'s forms contains a DataGrid uses label controls to act as a header for a group of columns. A bad example that\'s good enough for illustration of my point would be a grid containing the following columns: ID, Name, ID, Name first two columns would have a label positioned over them containing the text: "" Student "", whilst the second pair of columns would have a label over them containing the text "" "". Obviously, it\'s necessary to hear the contents of the labels order to understand the context of the grid\'s column headers. This scenario breaks the accessibility of the DataGrid, as the screen - reader has no mechanism to associate the labels with their positionally - associated columns. I\'ve tried setting the AccessibilityDescription properties of the labels, but this doesn\'t help as they never get focus. I also experimented with setting their AccessibilityRole properties to ColumnHeader, but no joy. I thought of trying to encapsulate the labels their columns within a couple of group containers, but this won\'t work as there\'s no way of containing some of the grid within one group control others within a second. This kind of visual layout is pretty common, but I can\'t see a way of improving things. Can anybody offer any suggestions, please?'
 ', I think you should have the whole grid thing wrap into a custom control which would have iths own accessibility handling routines could act on own way if the system queries it for accessiblility issues. I have written my own custom data listview control with its own accessiblility interface for years ago VB2005 which was working pretty well. examples you can find among VS sample projects could give you good ideas about how to develop your own custom datagrid which could announce not only the headers but the legend label, too.'

For an EM value, he explained that it was a percentage increase or decrease font size from the parent container.

Though I do design & development, my real love lies giving support to those whose sites are not working for 1 reason or another, especially due to site compromise. I say that because I think that unless a blind person is really really good w / spatial relationships, the field of design might not be the most desirable choice, though certainly all folks who work w / websites should have a good understanding of the CSS box model, etc. Things like web administration, database programming, systems related programming, etc., are all really good choices for blind professionals. Even amongst sighted designers today, the move seems to be toward design frameworks like Bootstrap, etc., which can greatly facilitate the design process. professionals who become familiar w / 1 or more of these frameworks & use them as the building blocks for designing sites can do their jobs really really well, but again, it does require that the person question have a good aptitude for spatial relationships. This is a quality that varies a lot amongst people - - I had a sighted friend I once told that if she ever went blind, I recommended she get some very strong glu, have someone apply it to her posterior, & then immediately sit down on a chair - - her sense of direction spatial relationships was that abysmal. I\'ve heard many who work the blindness field say that those blind from birth especially tend to have difficulty this area, but the other side of that coin is I\'ve seen some congenitally blind folks whose ability to fathom spatial relationships outranked that of many fully sighted individuals, so my opinion is that generalizations regarding that aspect are pretty meaningless best & downright discriminatory worst. I personally have quite good spatial capabilities, but I still find that computing where the various elements are on a webpage tends to cause me to literally have headaches rather quickly, so as you can imagine, that\'s not an aspect of working w / websites that I particularly enjoy.

 'Hi: I have tried to explain these types of concepts the past. best way is through tactile representations but you can explain it words if you give enough examples using real - world objects that she could feel understand. I would suggest having her join this list ask on list. being there are several people who will respond each will give diferent methods of understanding concepts so you get a cross - training approach as it were for a deeper understanding of what the words mean how diferent people register their meaning mentally. For example: An outline is like if you had a circle made of cardboard. If you wrapped a string around the circummfrance of that piece of cardboard it would be a border. Same if you had a square of cardboard or any other 2 dimensional "" object "" which something like a button or container is terms of programming. Now this is just an off the top of my head explanation of one concept but others would likely have better examples. After reading 4 or 5 of them I think this concept would make sense from one of the bulb moments reading one of the authors postings. This goes for pixels any other abstract visual concepts. One explanation may not turn the bulb on but several taken from diferent conceptual mental models might. In addition she can ask about any postings that sort of are understandable to get further explanations related to something that makes sense but, not quite yet as it were. As mentioned, it is easier if your student has had vision the past otherwise tactile mental references are almost a must but can certainly be done. I don\'t there is a simple answer to teaching visual concepts to a blind person unless they have the ability to ask about things that confuse them, as a teacher, you know that any unanswered questions will eventually either get answered or jump up to bite you if you ever have to use them later life. big thing is not that you don\'t know, but that you don\'t know you don\'t know; But, it sounds like as a concerned teacher you are addressing this so let your student learn from other blind folks now that she knows she doesn\'t know. You can explain these concepts to her that is a prerequisit, but to flesh out the understanding with other explanations, samples even resources that may be blind friendly she needs as much interaction with the blind community as possible relating to this field.

 'I feel like I have to jump on this as several of you guys have mentioned spatial awareness. I was a 3D professional for 15 years before I lost my sight suddenly totally. I used to work for architectural firms, media companies did a lot of interface designs for various clients as a freelancer. Loosing sight made me switch to coding as I had prior experience small scripts such as those for macromedia flash which I hate now lol. Anyway, I have been deeply reflecting on all the conjunctions one can make between the sighted sounded world, have made a lot of tests this regard. latest project, among all the others I am doing personally have delegated around for help, is to use the leap motion ’ s infrared object detection to project an image from the leap onto a relief print paper of the same image. leap picks up very high res stuff its fastest runs 100 frames per second so there is a lot that can be done. imagine a map where you trace your finger, the leap compares it against the image or let ’ s say node hiearchy contained the software that will bring up the right announcements or sound cues. I ’ ve done all the components but now that javafx is so accessible, I think I will port all the code into this platform so that anyone with a leap motion can play around with this. previous attempt using the leap was the web audio API mini framework I did for a course, but its limited by the fact that it had to be rendered within a web page. Now I can do everything locally so the next step is to connect the open AL framework with this javafx thing as well as the leap motion java API. Anyway, there are plenty of ways to make things or experiences accessible or imaginable through shapes, sounds, other say timbers of life. Hoping the student the best for her endeavor.'

 ""It really depends on what you are working on, this isn't entirely a screenreader user issue. A lot of people have trouble with getting to grips with a new codebase, especially if it is a messy one. Depending on the project here's some tips: - If it's a c or c++ project, look the header files. It's usually pretty telling what functions are what file just by looking those, as they usually only have function definitions, not their implementation. - For a web app, look the routes. They will tell you what route goes to what function what controller for example. - For anything else, see if there are conventions that were used. Use project - wide search if you have access to it, VS Code can do this for example, to get a list of where keywords you search for show up, what files, what lines, what those lines look like. Using outline view on files to list functions is also a good idea, as you discovered. Those are my strategies for this, I hope it helps a little: )""
 ""For python any text editor, you could use indentnav. It is an nvda addon which makes indentation look like a tree view. only place it doesn't work is vs code, the author has written an vs code extension with the same functions. I'd also appreciate the option to go to function definitions other files. For nvda development, I heard this is possible with vs code, but hadn't had time to try the setup yet. For my regular work c #, visual studio gives me both functions.""
 ""Hi, I tend to use Grep for looking up function definitions such ( I use WSL for NVDA source code management ). Even before that, I read source code docs ( least starting with what's available public ) to understand the overall structure read parts of source code that interests me expand from there. Regarding NvDA source code, I know that new contributors add - on writers are having difficulty understanding it fully. Part of this stems from lack of publicly viewable source code documentation that's easily discoverable. You can use Sphinx to build NVDA docs locally now, but I'm coordinating an effort to make the source code docs easily discoverable online ( if given a chance, I hope to discuss this later during the planned Zoom call, whenever it might be ).""

Considering I'm nearly finished with the requirements with my major, I'd like to possibly take the intro to programming course offered here during my last semester. It uses Python, which is accessible on all operating systems using the right tools ( WX Widgets ), but the last time I took a science course for the heck of it, it went rather badly, I did not do as well as I would have hoped. Part of the problem is that the professor was using a, I was the only one using a Windows the class, so do you suggest that I first talk to people see what OS is required? ( OS requirements are up to the professor. ) I mean, that class was using Java anyway, but still. If the python that teaches uses Tkinter rather than WX Widgets, then does Tkinter least work on a? I ask that because I'd love to learn anyway, so this could be a very good excuse. Thanks folks., Administrator of the AccessCop Network, previously Raeder24. org. Visit us on the web""

 'Oh thanks. I still have a semester before I have to worry about it, but just for reference, what framework for Python is normally taught? Do they normally use Tkinter or Wx Python?'
 ""honest answer is that I'm not sure what is typical for Python. I imagine if you can find out the instructor, that it would be a good idea to just ask.""
 ""I think, most of the time, TKInter will be used. However, even though TKInter's output will likely not be accessible, the coding will be. As long as things compile you should be fine, even if you cannot see your own output. As for having a Windows PC a mac class, what does that matter if you use Java as a language? This is, like Python, a cross - platform language. I could go up to youtube listen to the cs106a lectures which cover Java. Sure, they use Eclipse but if I learn some basic controls like Compiele, Run etc I could use sodbeans follow along just fine. What problems did you run to?""
 ""Most of the problems we ran into was that the professor had no idea how to use Windows, he wasn't sure if the same libraries were available for both Windows. I didn't know where to look, so it resulted me just not being able to follow along the class. And I'm sorry, but when I program any method, I'd like to be able to see my own output, I'd hope that other professors would respect that.""
 ""For the output issue, most programming language implementations NetBeans redirect standard out to the IDE, so theory it shouldn't be a problem Sodbeans. Now granted, I haven't actually tried the python plugin Sodbeans, but let us know how it goes if you try it.""
 ""That is unlikely because TKInter to my knowledge uses the QT toolkit which currently isn't accessible. To catherine, of course being able to view your output is preferable but it should not stop you from getting a good grounding a programming language, which I assume an intro to programming course is meant to give you.""
 ""Okay thanks. I'll keep you guys updated.""
 ""Now do remind me, isn't there now native support for QT Window - eyes? I thought that I read something about that, but I've never ran across anything with which to test it.""
 'actually, It appears you are right, it has been integrated into window - eyes 7. 5. 3. There is also an app for it app central, you might want to look the code for that see how exactly it functions. Using that you might be able to get somewhere with TKInter.']"

 'Yeah you can buy Eloquence from the Google Play Store, unlike iOS. Although, that is about the only true saving grace of Android accessibility. For best available accessibility experience, use TalkBack. Preferably on a Google Pixel. You can also download TalkBack onto Samsung. Also, last I tried it the Samsung keyboard gave me all kinds of fits even using their Voice Assistant screen reader, so download the Google keyboard.'
 'Hi Generally I would advise not using any standard Samsung stuff. Their hardware is great but their software is pants. I believe that Eloquence is no longer available on the Game Store. As to touching the screen bouncing all over the place, this could be down to sensitivity. If so then: Apps / Settings / Keyboard input / speed Keyboard Input may have changed to something else over the years, the function here checks for sensitivity. As someone with neuropathy I need to pump my sensitivity ( pointer speed ) up to 100 %. It can help to get someone to explain the layout on your device to get started too. Google is not consistent neither are developers but you can for instance find the ok buttons either just right of centre screen, above the button, the very bottom right corner or half way up the screen on the right.'

 'Hi Guys: suggestion would be to create an IDE for a particular language not to get so generic. reason is that you can get the biggest bang for the buck when it comes to time avoid MEF as much as possible. Once you have a platform that sings dances well for say Python, if designed properly module based it should be largely a matter of changing code literals to enable another programming language. There is also the option to add a new programming language to the visual studio IDE using add - ins or mef or something, not sure how they do it these days. That gives you all the already built features but with custom implementations if necessary or, least, that is my understanding. EdSharp is indeed getting older older but has been a popular IDE for a long time now I don ’ t think is working it anymore.'

 'Hi: word "" should "" is a parental word entails making folks always feel on one side or the other side of an issue. only point was that designing a app for a single language would take less time to come out with a usable product could be taylored to the exact requirements of an individual language. From a design point a generic IDE is very possible indeed. Again, for myself, mucking with MEF add - ins was a real pain for some simple additions to a project I had built. Using them to completely, or to massively, override, or, tweak existing things like code bases, UI elements database content, structure the like would be a considerable overhead to simple straight line programming which is what most people on list are use to working with. But, as a rule, most IDEs are indeed multi - language nature so I guess there is support for that design. Also, as mentioned, a generic design could allow for mef or add - ins to add additional capabilities as the project evolves. But, how many folks on list have experience actually creating mef or add - ins for some type of project especially if created over the. net platform? You need experienced programmers with the necessary skill set to continue the project after it is created the initial folks leave it for other projects they will necessarily get involved. This happened to the JAWS scripting project over time but fortunately it was picked up by Freedom I think is still use one form or another. But, the team that created the original scripts have moved on had stopped maintaining them over the years they were a great team of individuals indeed. I subscribe to the KISS philosophy, keep it simple sir! I do believe there is enough talent on list to create the project you are talking about I hope it gets off the ground. I really enjoyed watching the team work on the JAWS Project would enjoy watching this project grow up become a default defacto IDE for one, or more, languages that will be totally accessible to the blind community like the elderly EdSharp by has been. Later this is not a Criticism any way, just my thoughts if I were thinking of such a project general the "" blue sky "" cost / benefit level - always open to ideas.'
 ""An easy item I believe would vastly improve edsharp would be to impose some order on the menu system. There are simply far too many menu items this point. That is, add second level menu groups.

 'Hi Soronal: Did you use the older add - method or the MEF architecture? I found both to be lengthly to implement even fairly simple features they would, could be, daunting if considering major features like implementing a completely new programming language with code, files, UI elements, Dialogs, Compiler settings methodologys much more not to mention designers editors along with corresponding completion structures, syntax checkers for not only keywords but parameters how they are used a statement reffrences to objects variables defined all the related files that make up a project to the file being worked on all that jazz. This would seem to me to be a big project if created a native form but when I think of my experience with MEF an Add - In to create, or modify all these features would seem to me, again with my limited experience, to be a pretty big project to design, test, document implement for more than 1 language where you would want to write everything a set of MEF modules. If you used the Plug - In method wouldn ’ t it be a big project to implement this type of project allow for basically a complete overwrite of the project for vastly diferent requirements UI, files structures internals like compilers, syntax checkers, process execution debuggers messages whatever else would be required? I really don ’ t know. Perhaps there are existing modules you could include that performed many internals but you would still need to have ui elements processes to set control them doing all that using a plug - just seems rather complex from my experience with MEF. I am a pretty simple vb. net programmer, done a little with some advanced technicals but not worked on projects of this scope since when I was still sighted working the field if it is half what I think it might be if done to the level of say the Visual Studio IDE feature set. A simpler version is surely doable it could be built modularly implemented over time with new features being added a new executable being produced distributed. did a very nice job that piece of software has been used allot over the years by many blind folks indeed. So it can be done, hay he did it did it alone so a team can surely do it - I just cant wrap my mind around the technicals of the MEF version that would be practicle to develop for a few part - time programmers, sigh, but then these young folks are likely to go out just do it prove my doubts unfounded that would be a good thing me thinks.'
 "", It used MEF, I really didn't find it terribly difficult. Now, starting from scratch to do the same thing would indeed be a daunting task. However I believe that making a language - specific IDE then trying to make it generic would be even more difficult, that you would end up coding the expectations of the initial target language without even really thinking about it, that trying to remove those expectations would be more work than making it generic from the start.""
 'Hi Soronal: Perhaps you are correct. There would be diferent noncompatible modules so you could easily end up with a very large convoluted project me thinks. because I had a mess with MEF, if it is doable then that might indeed be an option as had mentioned. It will be interesting to follow this thread if the guys actually build something using MEF. documentation for MEF when it first came out was pretty sparse. Perhaps it isnt as bad as I remembered or perhaps I didn ’ t implement it properly I can pick up some new tricks. It could be a terrific project if designed as a core unit with the feature set features for individual languages implemented via MEF modules. That might indeed be a high quality project if done well. Have a good evening!'

 ""Hi, I think it all comes down to proper design this point. emacs - like way of giving you a text editor switching to a certain ' mode ' to provide language - specific commands help makes sense to me. This way, the language - specific parts are decoupled from the actual text editor, making it far easier to update a part of the whole. Now, this is all well good if you start a new project but some major refactoring would be required to whip the EdSharp codebase into shape. size of the single c # file frankly is atrocious makes it a nightmare to maintain.""
 'Hi Soronal: Using diferent languages is a good thing me thinks even within a single project. A project with some server - side code, perhaps some client - side code related'
 'a quick note Soronal: approach to analysis is to start with a "" blue sky "" approach then to trim the requirements, features, down as I run up against problems that can not be resolved a reasonable timeframe, cost basis or technical skill set learning curve. example is the "" blue sky "" - everything I could desire, approach only used to get a handle on the scope of what might be included a potential project where to start cutting features or design considerations. Any realistic solution would likely not be a visual studio clone using a ground - up approach to creating a cross - platform, cross language IDE for the blind community but if we start with the "" blue sky "" approach we can start to visualize the scope of a project come up with agreements on what to include what can be put off for another day. If designed this way we could ensure there are hooks to allow for features that may be cut case anyone wanted to implement them downline while still getting out a usable product a reasonable time. Anyway, have a good Turkey - I have to go to some relatives of my wifes side of the family, sigh!'
 'Soronal, Final posting until I hear from you, promise! To get an idea of the scope of the VisualStudio platform why a duplicate would have to be vastly reduced: source code of Visual Studio 2012 consists of approximately 50 million lines of code. So, a new IDE that has even one tenth the features would, might, require say 5 million? Then there is the fact that VS uses even massively more code already coded into the. net platform which I don ’ t think is counted the 50 million lines of Visual Studio code. This might help you estimating how many man hours would be required to implement some type of cross - platform, cross language IDE with similar features to Visual Studio. I think that an overall project level, design to implementation production you can count perhaps 20 to 50 lines of code per day - where do you start cutting?'
 ""Hello, Its sad that with all the editors, IDEs, etc., out already there are not more accessible options, or that they could be easily made accessible. I wonder which is easier, make new or fix one? However, with as many as there are, one more isn't going to hurt. That said, my experience is someone is going to have to take the initiative lay the ground work maybe more folks will add something. Perhaps this has already been done with 6Pad++? If not maybe something similar. I don ’ t' know how easy or possible it is but it'd also not hurt if the project could adapt plugins from other projects just using them an accessible way which would save a lot of time, hopefully leverage the maintenance work of other projects. For example, Notepad++ has plugins. Eclipse has many plugins. Perhaps 6Pad++ could add an API to add compatibility to Notepad++ plugins for example? accessibility issues overall are with Notepad++ UI, not the plugins working behinds the scenes. Anyways my thoughts. It'd be great to have something, but I unfortunately do not have the time or skill to do this. Maybe we make a pool hire some college CS interns next summer? And have them either build it, or fix an open source project like the Github editor who's name I forget. a thought.""
 ""If you want an IDE, why not use Visual Studio? I think the discussion originally centered around a [ somewhat ] more lightweight editor. I know there is a fine line between editors IDEs. But for example, a text editor is not going to have a debugger.

Anyways, see my other post for the rest of my thoughts. luck everyone.""
 'Hi: I do use Visual Studio, mostely just vb sql server ( ce ). had mentioned visual studio using MEF as models or tools. Talk was about building something that handles any number of languages - not sure if cross - platform. This sounds allot like the Visual Studio platform itself why I was taken back by any discussion that put any project this group could build that would look operate similar to Visual Studio using MEF or not. Using EdSharp as the model but bringing the code base up to date perhaps adding some project management features a couple of other tweaks is doable likely to be the way any project will go. I don ’ t know if EdSharp allows for adding new languages with full implementation of all the EdSharp features but if so then it may be a very good model for any real project. I like visual studio, full featured IDE, I liked the Express modules quite well so that would be my line of thinking if I were to design something from the ground up - single language IDE like vbIDE. exe or javaIDE. exe ect. But I do understand the desire for a platform where you can add new language support as plug - modules. Again, I would look EdSharp any other open - source projects that used this technique to evaluate if it were a doable approach for the available programming resources on list. In essance I agree with the original postings concerning just recreating EdSharp with a few new features some cleaned up code. Perhaps it could be designed to allow for plug - ins to add new languages features - don ’ t know how that would work but many editors use this method, if open source, their code bases researched. Anyway, Happy Turkey see you on the flip side.'
 ""Hello, 6pad++ has a plugin system, you can write plugins or scripts python 3, or C++.

 ""If I remember correctly, 6pad still doesn't allow multiple tabs?""
 'I just downloaded the latest beta1 1 ] And this 6Pad++ does allow multiple tabs. It looks like a standard typical tabbed interface to me. And you could be correct on the plugins idea, you\'d know more than I. main thought if there was a way to capitalize on the work of others for supporting languages such as syntax highlighting auto - complete. Of course, step one is perhaps screen reader users would like a different way of syntax highlighting. E. g., least one person told me they like how Eclipse gets the screen reader to say "" incorrect "". Perhaps auto - complete is more an IDE feature than a text editor too? For me since I do not program on a daily basis I rely on auto - complete to speed up my having to lok things up. But then, I am happy enough to use Eclipse for when I need to do this. And an accessible editor that\'d allow me to quickly read other code without so much editing would also help ( what I currently use PSPad for. ) main point is without either dedicated determined people or a large team, keeping the work to a minimum would increase the chance of success of the project. For me plug - ins that support especially languages which are dynamic htemseles would be a fairly constant maintenance chore. Perhaps hacking accessibility into an existing editor getting it into the main branch would still be the better long - term way? I do not know what editor would be a good choice or possible to do. So, no right or wrong answer. 1 ] ('
 'Hello, Yes, 6pad++ does allow multiple tabs; from its beginning. IN fact it\'s better than that: you can decide 1 - use a single window with tabs prevent multiple windows 2 - always use different windows never use tabs, run 6pad++ multiple instances 3 - Allow a mix Personally I don\'t like tabs that much, so I\'m happy with option 2. For syntax highlighting, of course it doesn\'t make sense for us to use colors, bold so on. Currently, 6pad++ use a standard textbox, so it isn\'t possible to use any formatting; even saying "" incorrect "".

I have not dealt with UML before, so I am curious as to how other blind developers deal with it. What programs are accessible? What techniques do you recommend? Thanks,'
 'Hi, I took several systems analysis Java courses that required the use of UML. In those cases, plantuml ( < is my best friend. It is accessible cross - platform. It works on Windows, OSX * nix systems.. UML is generated by writing a generic form of source code, then running the resulting text files through a UML generator written Java.. I haven ’ t perfected reading UML diagrams though. trick with plantuml diagrams is to allow the generator to calculate the best visual layout instead of controlling it through the diagram source. Any points I missed during those courses were a result of human logic a misunderstanding of the diagram source. tool generated everything as requested.. tool also produces entity diagrams for databases.. If you get stuck need some samples, get me off list.'
 'This is just because of my curiousity, but what is UML meant for?'
 'It ’ s a diagramming methodology used to create diagrams intended for business or systems design. Some diagram types include state diagrams, class diagrams, object diagrams, activity flows, etc …'
 'Hmm. I looked, but it seems that the java - atk - wrapper for Linux is not working with Java 9. Does it have a command line interface to use the meantime until the issue is fixed?'
 'Yes, use the java app as a cli utility']"

I need to do programming Typescript, so just as I would do on Windows, I installed visual studio code. However the interface doesn't seem to be that accessible with voice over. First of all, there is a second of delay when navigating using voice over key + right left arrow making the interface slow to use. Secondly, the editor, the code is not always rendered well on my braille display. Sometimes I have to move right left a few times on the brailledisplay to get a line on there correctly. Lastly, when removing text the editor, voice over is not following ( no voice no braille ). I have to press right / left arrow to know what I've deleted what should still be deleted. Anybody has a solution for this or knows another editor that supports both languages that I can use instead? Thanks advance""
 ""It's always good to look into an OS's accessibility coding options before buying anything. Yeah, VSCode on isn't very good. You can use TextMate though. You won't get as good suggestions but least you'll be able to read write it well, there are rotor options to navigate symbols. You can also use Emacs with Emacspeak on the, use - mode related packages. However, not many people here use this option, I think, so""]"

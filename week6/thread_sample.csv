 ""Hello! I've just had the opportunity to try this. These sensors are very sensitive, so I am unable to do this unless i modify the application simply have it count upwards, then log when the numbers above 25 are reached, but this may still require a slightly altered approach when receiving from the serial port. I attempted to modify the serial port section accordingly, but it doesn't seem able to contain the logging mechanism unless I am doing it incorrectly. Unfortunately, it seems as if the only approach is to have the logging mechanism span several classes order to properly redirect the output, then continually output to the console simultaneously. SO, I think this becomes complex, least when it comes to copying the console output to a text file when a condition is reached. I of course know how my code works, but I'm not sure where to apply anything more so that it works as expected when it comes to this particular feature. That's why I'm asking someone with more experience with this language. I have a tendency to make issues appear much more complex than they might be, so I may be overlooking the obvious solution here. act of having the program behave differently depending on a condition isn't the hard part particular this case, it's mostly because of the apparent complexity involved with getting this to work as desired when a number is reached. Obviously, the general scope is to have the file logging suspended when it is below, but as soon as the temperature reaches over, the logging resumes. temperature is not given decimals as is customary, but you wouldn't know the calculations for the temperature because the Arduino code is not included here. It isn't very relevant to this issue, as the needs to do the work to store the information. I would have preferred to write this to an SD _ card connected to the Arduino board, but that would have been beyond the scope of this project. All you essentially see are numbers, nothing else. That conforms to the project requirements. So, summary, I wouldn't mind a definitive reply due to my lack of understanding for this particular language. In""
 ""Ummm, I really don't see why the sensitivity of the probe matters all, what matters is the form of data the device produces. If you could describe that it would likely be your best route to some actual help. If you want to log to the file every time you get a temperature reading but only log to the console when you get a reading over 25C that would still be a matter for your DataReceived event handler, it would just have two actions instead of one. One thing to add, I would be somewhat surprised if such a device were to produce data that could meaningfully be shoved into a string as - is. likely would be to read the incoming data into a byte array ( using SerialPort. ( Byte [ ], Int32, Int32 ) work with it from there.""
 ""Hi! You already know the type of data the device produces. What I have outlined is quite literally what it needs to do, how it shows it. It doesn't display anything but numbers as output, that's all the device currently is required to do. I'll change certain things around later once I actually get this to function as expected, but this won't change anything all except how the information is presented the file, so it will still be capable of logging it as long as the numbers don't change. solution itself is actually incredibly simple, I'm just not sure where or how to make the adjustment given how the information is actually logged to the file, unless there is an easier way to deploy such a feature without losing console output. In summary, what I need is a console application which reads the serial data from the COM port after choosing which port to use. When the program begins reading the data, it shows each reading on a different line so the numbers don't actually blend together. only information that will be shown are numbers, like 25, nothing more than that. That's the exact number format. When the number is greater than 25, the will start to log the incoming information, but hopefully it's still possible to show console output while logging the information. Once the temperature decreases down to 25 below, the logging stops. I'm really sure I cannot make it clearer than that. solution is obvious - make an if statement that, when the number is greater than 25, starts to log the information to file. Even the problem is a very simple algorithm. Currently, the only function the application does not perform is logging when the temperature increases above 25, that is the part that needs fixing so that it does what it needs to do. As mentioned above, that is actually how the numbers show up. Again, if it's smarter to drop the code for the real time output logging, I suppose it isn't a huge deal if the numbers above 25 don't show as long as they write to the file. That's pretty much what's important, what needs to work. numbers below do not need to be written to the file all, just displayed the console. I can't tell you more than this, since that's actually all there is to it, so I can't elaborate. This is how the data is displayed, the form of data it is, its purpose function. It really doesn't bother me how a solution is reached, as long as it logs anything above the number of 25, discards anything below that only shows it the console. That's all that matters. That should clear things up if it wasn't clear to begin with. Thanks!""
 'No, I do not know what data the device produces. I mean, it could be something like { time - stamp } { temp reading } or maybe just { temp reading }, or it could be something else entirely. data could already be formatted as a string or it might be pure binary. I do not know any of those things, yet that is exactly what is needed order to be able to perform any sort of tests on the data read from the probe.'

1162,jaws-remote-desktop,"[""Hi All. I'm possibly needing to use windows xp remote desktop a few times a week while working from. problem is this... we use visual source safe 6. 0 for those who have tried accessing it remotely, should I go on? grin. It is terrible. I've followed all the tweaking suggestions for vss didn't see much improvement all. So I have two options the way I see it. First, try to find a client that will interact with ms source safe that is not the visual source safe client to maybe speed things up. That one is more less a starry wish grin. Second option is to look into letting a machine on the network the office interact with vss remotely I use xp remote desktop to access the client pc so the office pc is doing all the work locally on the network. If I have to use the second option, how much does it cost to have the remote authorization for jaws? I seen some talk about it last week think it was. All input advice / suggestions welcomed!""
 ""Hi, price the for the JAWS Remote Access license is £125. At current exchange rates, that's somewhere around $222. I suspect therefore that it may be somewhere between $200 $250 the. On the whole, using Remote Desktop is a good option, as it removes the need to use any thick client software over the wire. I also find that JAWS functions pretty well under those conditions. However, I must point out that I have never tried it over a broadband connection, so have no idea how responsive it is like that. I've only used it on an internal LAN, where it performed reasonably well. You just need to install an unlicensed copy of JAWS 6. 0 or later on your server, remembering to install the Server component of the JAWS Remote Access software. Then, make sure you have the client component installed on your PC, along with the rest of JAWS of course. Remote Access software will then use your local PC's license to activate the server copy as a fully licensed, non - time limited copy. most annoying downside of the JAWS Remote Access, is the fact that you get no speech whatsoever from the remote server until you have successfully logged. As anybody who has the most incidental experience of working with servers knows, there are umpteen things that can legitimately happen before you get to successfully log, this can cause some rather irritating problems when the log on procedure stops with no feedback all. E. g. expiring passwords, error reports from earlier system errors on the server, so forth. If you have no sighted assistance available the time, this can be a real show - stopper sometimes. It's well worth reading up on the alternate keystrokes for Windows operations while Remote Desktop, which are documented the JAWS online help. most important ones being how to switch between full screen normal window mode, perhaps how to open the Run dialog, on those occasions when you don't get any speech back from the server automatically, have to manually start JAWS remotely. I would also recommend setting JAWS to use a different synthesizer voice when a Remote Desktop session, so that you are immediately reminded when you are working locally or remotely.""
 'Messagethanks for the input david. Much appreciated. Is there any sort of trial for the jaws remote desktop support?'
 ""Hi, I don't know of a trial. Like said, the biggest problem is logging on. You can set Remote Desktop to help with that to some degree, I've gotten it to where I just needed to enter a password. Of course, as says, if errors are encountered, multiple sessions were left open you don't know it, this can be a problem. Otherwise it works well. I have used Remote Desktop JAWS over a broadband connection a VPN / WAN type setting it worked well. A bit sluggish on occasion, but for the most part, no probelm it felt like I was right the other machine. * *""
 'MessageHi. So jaws literally composes an accessible desktop such for you to interact with just like your normal one? is that correct? situation is that Microsoft suggests to use a client pc on site to control via xp remote desktop so when using source safe the client on the internal network is doing all the traffic checking / out projects etc. If I wanted to control a specific client pc on my company internal network, would I install the server jaws component on that client pc? Forgive my ignorance, am a little new to remote access grin.'
 ""Hi, Yes, precisely. Your on - site client PC would be the server to your PC. So the JAWS server compoent should be installed. In fact you can just install client server components both on both PC's so you can access either way, they do not interfere, JAWS 6. 2 installs both by default I believe assuming the proper license is had. * *""

1117,VB6-Tab-Order,"[""Hi all, I have a VB form which shows a number of rows of controls. Each row consists of a text box which the user enters a code, up to 6 subsequent text boxes which are enabled labelled according to what value was entered the code field. In order to determine which controls to enable label, I have to wait until the user has entered the code, attempts to leave the first text box. This normally means using the LostFocus or Validate events. However, because the 6 data controls on the line start out as disabled when the user enters the code, focus passes to the code field on the next line when they hit the tab key. Trying to set focus on the first enabled control on the line during either the LostFocus or Validate event does not work, because focus has already been sent toward the next line. What happens is that focus moves to the first textbox on the current line, then moves immediately on to the next line anyway. Using the parameter of the Validate event to stop the movement of the focus to the next control doesn't work either, because once again, focus moves to the first enabled control, then immediately back to the original code field. Is there any way to intercede the tabbing process, make VB wait until you've finished enabling fields before moving on to the next control? It sounds very unlikely to me.""
 ""Hello You can subclass the form window eat the tab but I really don't recommend it. I would be inclined to use a more standard UI form.""
 'a thought - - could you make the conditional controls enabled but invisible, then adjust them accordingly upon receiving focus?'
 'Hi, Sadly, I\'m not able to redesign the form, as it\'s pretty much been forced on us by the nature of an Oracle application. However, a sudden moment of lucidity, I have just realised that there is a control between the code field the first variable control. In the circumstances where this behaviour is occurring, this control is disabled. Yet the circumstances when it is not, the focus moves to it, thus the next field on the same line. So I\'ve decided to change the UI so that the second permanent field is only made ReadOnly those circumstances, instead of disabled, order to guarantee that it is the next field the tab order each time. That way, the problem doesn\'t arise. It\'s rather like the old joke about the bloke going to the doctor, saying, "", it hurts when I do this... "" doctor replies, as you did, "" Well, don\'t do it then! ""'
 'Hi, Making the controls invisible would also prevent them from receiving focus, so the problem would be exactly the same. try though.'
 'Oh well! Another try is a gimmick, I know, but what if not invisible by means of property but invisible by means of foreground background colors being the same?'
 ""Hi, That would prevent the problem, yes. But it would also mean the user could click enter data into a field which may not be a part of the transaction. One could validate for this of course, but given the number of controls involved, it would both mean a tedious user experience, more coding than I like to contemplate. I've just tested the solution I suggested to, it works fine. I. e. having the user tab into an intermediate field always, before the subsequent variable fields. As that field is there anyway, the only reason I was disabling it was to prevent the user from changing the value some circumstances, I think making it read only is acceptable. From a blind user's perspective, it's actually better, because you can see what the value is, without having to resort to browsing the screen with the JAWS cursor. Thanks for the ideas though.""

3076,MSTranslator-Sample-App,"[""Hi: is posting up a really, really basic Translator App that uses the free version of the Microsoft Translator API. It is intended as just a skeleton, no real features no error handling nor help only one form a couple of basic API methods used. I am thinking of adding the use of an external process to display a help text file when f1 is pressed, actually already there but with only a MessageBox displayed when f1 is clicked, to demonstrate how to use the Process operation VB. net ( it would be pretty much the same other languages ). By adding features one a time there could be increasingly complex versions of the first MSTranslator Application demonstrating features, technicals or logic, as each iteration of the application is added. That way you can pick up what you need get through it fast without allot of extra code you dont need. Anyway, way I handle help is to create one text file for each form a project. Then, when either help is clicked from the Menu or F1 is pressed I execute a process on the. txt file with a wait specified so processing the app itself does not continue until the user's default text editor is closed. I also hide the form so they cant tab to it muck things up that way. This way you dont have hard coded text strings, you can modify the files anytime including runtime the users can edit modify their help files if they want to shorten, lengthen or leave themselves notes. Also, it makes it possible to translate the help files using the TranslationHandler class which is the fundemental class for translation processing within the MSTranslator project itself. Note that this method is great for accessing websites from within DeskTop apps as well I have used it my Financial Platform other projects with good success. If someone is thinking of picking the project up running with it I can put this feature place to help give you a head start on building a translatable help system for your project, or, seeing how to first use the Process class operations for further research learning. It is also handy for editing other files run - time. If interested let me know I will add code for this feature - not all the bells whistles but the basic process method on the one form of the skeleton project to help get started learning about this operation. Then, if he wants, can post up the new extended version on his site place of the one he is pposting up now.

I can't actually use it. lol It made me realise that a good suggestion for Microsoft might be to add a special keyboard command that would force Windows to automatically load default video audio device drivers for those people using adaptive technology. Otherwise, it is a rather sticky situation. Funny how I never had this trouble updating my sound card drivers though..., my nephew's going to have his work cut out for him this.""
 'Or maybe another idea would be to have a keyboard command to restore the most recent restore point... Anyway, ramble over.'
 'setting that you speak of sounds like a good idea.'

388,android-and-ios-development,"[""Hi. Got visual studio 2019 community. And was interested learning how to do cross platform apps using xamrin forms. I don't have a mac. Do have a virtual machine, vm ware player. So wondering. How do I use this, don't have any mac or ios devices. Would a virtual machine work, then have to then sign up for a developer account then download the mac, then x code. If this is not going to work, what alternatives would you recommend. completed my certificate eiv networking course looking to enroll the diploma of networking which I will be enrolling the new year. So having some down time a couple of people friends of mine, suggested that. So how to proceed. So also any good tutroials for doing some apps starting out with android ios. Have not really done any thing all with this space. Have used xml done forms, then hand coded the elements like panels, stack panels, text areas, buttons, lists, combo boxes, browsers, etc a programming course a few years back. And was using visual studio 2015 or 2017. Any ideas. Thanks.""
 ""As far as I know, virtualization software wouldn't work. There are websites that give you a mac machine on the cloud technology. Search for Coulds will surely find it. I would be happily give you more information but apple products are not supported Iran. Even such websites don't provide their services to us.""
 ""For iOS development, my understanding you pretty much do need a real mac a real iPhone / iPad. Sighted people can do development the cloud, but then they would have to test on iPhone simulator, which is not accessible to the best of my knowledge. I have also seen some articles, on how to install Hackintosh inside a virtual machine on Windows, then make sure that real iPhone is connected to that virtual machine, so that you can develop things on virtual machine test them on your real iPhone. However this way is very complicated, likely you won't be able to install Hackintosh without sighted help.""
 'I just watched a slick video where some one from Microsoft demonstrated ssh ’ ing into a mac across the local network used a simulator on a mac pre - installed presumably with xcode other developer components. This should work if you have an ios device connected to your mac it should show up with the simulators the list let you install, though with apple, you never know. It ’ s no wonder people prefer to start out on android for development unless they already prefer mac for other things. It ’ s a steep learning curve on entry;.'
 ""Oh, that's what I do - I ssh onto my mac to compile my project I edit source files Notepad++ - I had to share my Mac's hard drive via SMB. It's not rocket science. But that's me - I cant' write code without IndentNav. Others who are more familiar with VoiceOver can develop right on. And I would disagree that the learning curve for iOS development is any worse than Android curve. Except perhaps you'd need to learn VoiceOver on the mac if you're not familiar with it, but that's separate from accessibility of tools.""
 'When writing for the, does one use a standard language such as C++, Visual Basic or Python, or does the system use proprietary codes language? I did some nuts bolts programming decades ago electronics school for several controllers such as the MC68xx series, mostly to control stepper motors the like, also did some simple stand - alone programs to run on a DOS PC. We had to know the architecture of the processors for that work. What about nowadays, for programming for the stuff. Is this knowledge required? Thanks for any feeback.'
 'Hi, first programming was on DOS using Turbo C from. A lot has changed since then. If you just want to develop something to run on MacOS or iOS, you ’ d probably want to use,; If you want to build something to run on multiple platforms, you might want to use Python ( choose your GUI library wisely ) or Electron ( using Typescript / or Javascript ). You can build GUI programs that will run on Windows,, Linux with either of those technologies. If you want to build a app that runs on either iOS or Android, there are technologies that claim to do that fairly well. Your mileage may vary I have no idea if those cross - platform app technologies integrate well with the accessibility frameworks of Android or iOS. I ’ m on details as I ’ m not an app developer general. I ’ m starting to get to that space after losing my sight. Above is just a bit of what I ’ ve learned. What I ’ ve also learned is there are some very strong opinions regarding how to do something. So, back to the old days, some things never change 😉']","['marvkin' 'h.vasheghani' 'anton.malykh' 'erik' 'anton.malykh' 'wpg67'

Now, if they are objects, can I use a event with those objects? Why I ask this crazy thing? I have a boolean variable, a public boolean variable. I called this variable as condition; Public Condition as boolean. But some cases, condition needs to be false, or true, each case when condition switch to false / true or true / false, I need that something else happen. I know that I can write the code every time when condition switch. for example, if a a event, when a process happen, or when the user make a click on a button, I can write something. If condition = true then do this do that. EndIf.

 ""Hi, f8 key is only mapped if you choose the Visual Basic 6 keyboard scheme. You don't have to use that keyboard scheme to write Visual Basic. If you change the keyboard scheme back to Default, then the keys for stepping through code change as below: F11 = f8 F10 = shift+f8 Shift+f11 = ctrl+shift+f8 And so on. These days, I tend to stick to the default keyboard scheme, so that I don't get confused between the different IDEs. There are subtle differences that can sometimes make life quite complicated if you forget.""
 ""There's no point using macros. VS contains completely configurable keyboard schemes. So you can simply change the scheme to switch the step into command to any key combination you like. If you really don't want to change keyboard scheme though, I suggest the best thing to do is add script procedures to your JAWS configuration to pass the f8 key through. It would be something like: Script StepInto ( ) SpeechOff ( ) TypeCurrentScriptKey ( ) Pause ( ) SpeechOn ( ) PerformScript SayLine ( ) EndScript Associate this script with the f8 key, not only will the key be passed through, but JAWS will speak the next line to be executed as well.""

With the next public release of code ( later this month ) we will see a significant improvement the capabilities described this post, but we still have work to do between beta RC especially with'
 'Well clearly we need to make our voices heard, but, having said that, the only reason why built voiceOver into its OS was because they were about to lose the k - 12 educational market share the due to the inaccessibility of the OS. Pressure was being brought to bear because Sec. 508 of the Rehab act required accessibility & Apple\'s offerings simply weren\'t. Unless some similar loss of market share could be brought to bear against MS, nothing\'s gonna get done. I also suspect that the major screenreader manufacturers will see to that as well. We\'re a very small minority of the population, &, until the mindset changes from "" build it cheap "" to "" build it to be usable by all "", which likely won\'t happen any of our lifetimes, it\'ll simply be business as usual. So, yeah - - go for it - - but don\'t hold your breath, either, or you\'ll end up a very unappealing shade of blue. As pointed out on another list, probly the only way we\'re gonna get stuff done is to band together & do it ourselves, & that depending on sighted folks to do it for us or even help us is a mistake. NVDA is as close to that as we\'ve come, but without a display driver, it\'ll likely never be able to be used on the broad spectrum of apps out there that, because of failure to use / expose objects, require such. All righty then! That\'s my dose of gloom, doom, & cynicism ( or very possibly realism ) for the morning.'
 ""Hi, This is getting out of my depth of knowledge, so please take it for what it is, uneducated. I understand that NVDA has something called display hooks or something to that effect. I don't know if this is anything akin to what you are talking about,, or not. Something is also nagging my memory, which is that I thought that Microsoft's desire was to do away with the display driver that they got together with screen reader manufacturers to build, because they wanted to remove legacy code from whatever the next generation of Windows after Vista was going to be the time, which is now Windows 7, we are now even moving on from there, so hay, I'm done rambling for now. Thanks.""
 'Hi,, yes I think you are right. NVDA does have some display hooking abilities. I am not sure it is the same layer of mirror drivers as some of the commercial screen readers but they do have things working such as caret tracking basic edit fields, where MSAA is not sufficient to do this. They added the ability the past 1 - 2 years or so. And yes Microsoft has wanted to do away with the display driver chaining. According to a GW Micro presentation on Windows 8, this has occurred Windows 8. So if that is true, the screen readers that utilize the accessibility APIs the best will have the best advantage the early going. Time will tell if this really pans out. I think something wil have to give either some displaying driver chaining will still occur, or else a lot of legacy apps will no longer be usable by screen readers.'

 'Hi all I am decidedly not up on whatever Microsoft is promising with Narrator, but recently I got to play crash test dummy for their usability group with a tablet running whatever their build of Windows 8 was. I THINK but am not sure not going to check that I told the testers the following: - - I am kind of a tablet / touch - screen skeptic because for me tactile orienters are important to my work habits, kind of wired this point. So my first preference would e a keyboard. But I ride the bus a lot would happily compute while commuting except that a keyboard separated from the screen is two things to hold onto instead of one. - - It would be helpful if the people running the test knew Narrator magnifier well enough to suggest topical tweaks of settings. - - crash test dummy part is that A LARGE percentage of the things they asked me to try, tweaks Narrator would not have mattered because some other key functionality was not properly connected. - - I worked completely nonvisually for awhile was breaking things left right. At some point the test suggested I try Magnifier. things not connected. MAYBE I would get into liking a tablet if Magnifier worked things were connected to other functionality.'
 ""Hello, Does anyone know why corporations like Microsoft Google try to build their own screen readers using sighted programmers blind testers? There are tons of screen readers out there! Why don't they take System Access or one of those integrate it into their rather than trying to build their own terrible imitation of a parity of a screen reader? Cromvox uses that stereotypical icky female voice that is like the first option on SAPI so does the Amazon reader. What will it take for corporations to get it through their collective heads that no matter how much money or how many credentials their accessibility teem has, their screen readers will never compare to the ones out there because the ones out there are for the blind made by the blind are maintained by the blind who use them on a daily basis. Does anyone know why they can't get this through their heads? Maybe we should draft an email explaining this send it to all major accessibility teems all the CEOs of the big corporations that is signed by a ton of people. We blind people won't call something accessible that is not the only way to make a screen reader that we would be happy with is to not make one all use one that is out there! This is my observations, what do other people think? Because if platforms like Windows 8 little computers like the cromvox are going to become the norm, we blind will be left the dust if we don't get accessibility from the get go. Thanks,""
 ""Well If you want to go that route, I'd not recommend System Access all, for that bearly supports any of the important applications that any normal IT person would need for work if you catch my drift. But I do know what you mean. It shouldn't be too hard to draft an email send it onto Microsoft anyway. other corporations, I don't care so much about, but that may be because I'm thinking terms of an administrator, not the terms of a programmer.

She is well aware of what is going on, an she is as we speak connecting me with the proper channels.""
 'Because for MS least narrattor is only really meant to be just enough of a screen reader to get something else installed. Anything beyond that is just a tick on the packaging. We are a small enough slice of the market they risk so little by not catering to us that it does not make sense from their standpoint to make a huge investment such a product. the amount of work FS does towards jaws for example, look how much FS charges for jaws. Would you be interested paying$800 for an screen - reader enhanced windows from MS? I doubt it, while spreading that cost over the entire install base would bring it down signficantly people would still complain, rightly so. I do fact think MS is going about things generally the right way, put lots of effort the API side so that programmers can make their products accessible, but let someone else take care of the user interface side.'
 ""FS only charges so much because they are greedy. They could bring it down if they wanted to, then they could make scripting JFW easier by allowing for other languages to be used ( native languages such as C #, C++, or anything else ), like GW micro does. That's my biggest pet - peeve with JAWS.""
 ""Hello, I don't know about Windows 8, but Google Amazon actually build the screen reader into the program. screen reader is especially built can only run on that one application, kind of like Kurzweil, just 1000000000000000000000 times worse. Also, wouldn't it be easier to take an already existing screen reader like NVDA put that with the windows package? Or a demo version of Jaws? Or System access? It seems to me like Narrator would be just so much more work. Even if they had to build the screen reader to fit the program or operating system, I would think it would be easier to adapt another screen reader.

Microsoft doing something like this would be pointless. Narrator works well enough to get things installed, least on seven - - I couldn't sit through the podcast for eight, so I don't know much about how it works there. Another point I want to bring up - - I brought it up when Seven was coming out, was there were rumors about it being totally 100 % unaccessible, for a while, it was exactly that. There was some workability with it, but it had a lot of problems. There were people complaining about vista ( longhorn anyone? ) being unaccessible because m$ was supposedly changing this that, again it was for a while. We need to accept the fact that because we need to rely on assistive technology, we can't just pick up the newest shiniest technology that'll be that. We need to give things time to catch up with accessibility. It sucks, I'm sure someone will advocate for bashing m$ with a hammer, but it's honestly not all Microsoft's fault it's something we have to deal with.""
 ""One problem with some of the screen readers with respect to Windows 8 is that they rely heavily on the mirror driver which MS has said will no longer be useful for supplying the type of information that it did the past. This means that the current versions of JFW Window - Eyes will be useless with Windows 8 until they are modified to get the info a different way. I understand that NVDA System Access don't suffer from this problem. I wonder if JFW will be able to even have a Jaws cursor the new world that works the same way if not think of all the scripts that will be broken.""

No matter who you are buying a is the same for every mac sold. No difference for being different. That difference is the reason those third party companies say they have to charge so much more.

Second, what the companies charge is not greed. It's how life works. No company is going to make a living off of handing out $20 versions of Jaws. Welcome to capitalism!

 ""Hi, Sorry if you've seen this message before, but I feel that it's worth posting as part of this discussion. I feel that NVDA is getting to the point where it can be talked about as a serious player, I'll be donating regularly. nvda users, Sorry for the long email, please bare with us to the end. time has come to show your appreciation your determination for NVDA development to continue. to the economic downturn NV Access has received less grants than what we would have hoped for. We all have a duty an obligation to request from the organizations working for the blind such as the RNIB, or AFB / NFB, or the appropriate blind organization your country, to tell them that NVDA has been continues to be a useful valuable tool to provide accessibility for all of us that they should promote sponsor the excellent work that is being done. Despite all the politics the slow movement within organizations, we the real NVDA users are able to keep NVDA development going if each one of us took their responsibility seriously. This is without having to wait for organizations or companies to give grants to NV Access. to many advantages, benefits unique features of NVDA, the number of NVDA users are growing but sadly the personal donations are not matching this increase are often not regular. What we want to say clearly is that any regular donation large or small, will keep their full time employment working for NVDA. What we have to remember is that they are two blind individuals like you me, but are gifted with rare skills that many of us could benefit from. We should work hard not to put them a situation where they have to choose between doing something that they love beleave ( improving NVDA ), having to provide the necessities for their families children. current funding is able to keep both of them employed until september this year, if the donations haven't increased by then they may have to look for alternative employment. Even if one of them leaves the other continues the work load will be a lot harder, progress will be much slower. This will directly impact on us because we will have to wait for much longer before tickets can be solved, which will cause us a lot of frustration anguish. This is not what we have been accustomed to the last few years, we often see regular releases each version is superior to the previous one. We all need to understand that, what is required is for each one of us to donate according to our circumstances, may it be as little as 5 or 10 dollars a month, this will be enough to keep the project going. We Thank those of you who already donate on a regular basis. Put this context, we easely spend 5 dollars on a coffee or 10 / 20 dollars on a meal when we eat out, surely NVDA deserves this token amount? people do charity events, such as running a marathon, doing a tandem ride, or baking seling cakes their community to raise money for canser research or any other worth while charity, we can all do the same but for NV Access which is also a charity. Please don't lose this opportunity to support NVDA, because if we fail to set up regular donations, a few months time we will all have to start paying for expensive screenreaders because NVDA would not have been developed updated to match our latest needs. We are writing this email as individuals that strongly believe open source, as volunteer contributors to NVDA. We understand that it is hard for to keep sending emails asking for donations because it feels bad to keep asking, but we the users should act before we reach the point of no return. Please repost / translate or anything that you feel appropriate, please don't forget to raise donations. for donations: you, Mesar, NVDA translators. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _""

7446,UML-diagrams-designmodeling-for-blind-devs-is-it-possible,"[""Hello, I have a question regarding UML modeling for blind developers. Currently the univercity I have a course related to UML diagrams modeling with MagicDraw application from NoMagic. From my experiences after trying out this application, it seems it is not accessible for screen reader users. If there are any people who have / had some experience related working with UML things, it would be very great to hear from you, how could you manage it if you are blind? Is that mission possible for blind devs, or is it a really complicated thing to do? there are other similar software to MagicDraw ( e. g., Ms Vicio, but from what I herd it is also not so good for screen readers ), or some online tools which can help to design UML charts? Sorry for asking lots of questions one time, since I never had any experience with UML, as from what I know almost anything related to drawing / painting images / charts never was really accessible for blind developers. I'm wrong here though... To go a bit detail, talking specifically about situations MagicDraw, I'm even unable to complete a new project / diagram creation ( let's say I want to create an activity diagram; At the final step of creation process, it asks me to addd some activities to a diagram from the table, which I'm not able to navigate through any choices available that table so... ). So summarizing everything: is UML design / diagram modeling a possible thing to do? If so, what steps should I take to be pointed into the right direction? Thanks for any info.""

2229,How-do-I-execute-another-programme-from-within-V-B-A,"[""morning, I am creating a macro within MS -. It is my appointment book which can span several weeks but I want to automatically select one week, reformat it a predictable way then add additional formatting codes before submitting the resulting text to a DOS Braille translation programme on to my Braille embosser. I can't seem to find out how to pass control off to the DOS application. I am pretty sure it is possible, anyone help? I want a simple one - touch method so an untrained person can punch me out a current week listing not to mention saving me a lot of trouble with automating this. I have been using a dedicated DOS with very different text editing software macro methods up until this time. Thanks..""
 'Perhaps the command might work?'
 'Hi, I would think much depends what braille translator you are passing it to, whether or not it supports a DOS Command Line to emboss. Although Windows based, I do know that Duxbury has an "" Emboss Direct "" facility within itself which does just that, but of course you would need to have Duxbury..'
 'DOS programme does have a large number of parameter capabilities I do have Duxbury but somehow can\'t get it out of limited demo mode just now. big deal just now is getting a lot of formatting done to make the pages read nicely inserting formatting codes into the document so the braille translator will also play nicely. It is all to run with a single keystroke or two. I don\'t now have any idea about how I would go about inserting DBT formatting codes into a word document for forcing line breaks list formatting braille page breaks into a document for importation into Duxbury. I suppose it is possible? Essentially what I have is a flat file with date then below that a series of times against which names other notes are entered. macro is to begin monday select text to the following monday. Then the embossed output is to put each day on a separate page preferably with hanging indent for line overrun. What I want is no human intervention instant braille output. schedule can change rapidly frequently I don\'t have time to fiddle with formatting braille output. staff is part time becoming increasingly occasional for a variety of reasons. Braille translators are not cooperative when it comes to that sort of formatting, they want to disrespect line endings blank lines which, for literary braille is generally desirable. I suppose though that calling DBT from a VBA macro would be similar to a DOS programme. While I didn\'t get a chance to work with the command today a look the VBA Help seems to indicate it will work. When I was reading Help yesterday I got "" Run "" which will execute another macro from within a macro a few things like that. challenge just now is getting formatting codes inserted where they need to be. It isn\'t too hard to Search & Replace "" MONDAY "" with say "" ~P ~! ~C MONDAY "" to set a new page center the day but to then skip to the end of the line after the date to insert the code for a blank line is proving to be unreliable, the MS - insertion point isn\'t always where you think it should be.'
 ""Thanks, That looks like it will do the trick. I just wasn't forming my look - up correctly for the Help engine I guess.""

Microsoft automatically recognizes the source format based on its extension other characteristics. Later versions of Microsoft support more conversions, e. g., to PDF. Wordvert may not be able to convert every source file given as input. number converted out of the total is indicated the end of the process. Examples: wordvert C: \\ temp \\ report. doc converts a single document to a file the same path except for a. txt extension wordvert *. docx htm converts files from. docx to. htm format the current directory wordvert c: \\ reports pdf c: \\ temp converts all files the reports directory to. pdf files the temp directory - - - - - - - - - - Installation Unzip the archive the web address to the directory C: \\ Wordvert Then run the executable Wordvert. exe.

 'Hi Yes, it works great if I use "" Save as pdf "", I just wonder if the Com object functionality that \'s tool builds on also has all these features built. If both rely on the same underlying functionality, as I hope, this should not be a problem, but sometimes "" batch "" convertion APIs do not offer the fine tuned controls that you can get through "" save as "" functionality, may be additional sotware convertion has been added somewhere else the Office ocodebase, it is large enough, believe me.; ) I just want to confirm this, as batch convertion of multiple files to accessible PDFs ( provided the originals are formatted satisfactorily ), would be a very handy thing to have.'

 'Hi, This might be a good starter for getting to know the stuff.'
 'I think there is nothing as "" correct way "" of starting with programming. You should think about what do you want to achieve with programing.'
 'I was electronics the Air force 30+ years ago. I first want to say don ’ t give up on your electronics. You can still do a lot of it blind. Second Like this previous reply said there is no one set way to start coding. You are starting over but there are a lot of things electronics that help you understand programming because programming was born from making a configurable way to control electronics. You should already know a lot of binary logic better known as Boolean algebra a lot of the debugging you did electronics will make debugging programming easier. best way to start is just to grab a few tutorials online. And start coding. Do as little block copy as you can to start read the code, read lots of code. There are lots of books on book share, there are lots of books on bundle. All of those are great. When you get down to it though it is about knowing what you want to code finding examples just trying it. Python is perfect for getting started because you can start right away doing powerful stuff with lesser amounts of knowledge. I am currently reading a book called “ Coders ” It is not about learning coding, but it is 15 of the super programmers interviewed. When I mean super, I mean people like guys who wrote emacs, lisp, JavaScript, things like that. All of them started out just hacking on the weirdest machines trying to make them do something. Almost none of them started with formal classes. With Google now you can learn to code just buy using the search engine asking things like how I get a number python, how do I loop through a list python. Etc. You search for that open the page up read. It does help to joins group like this some discord channels just ask questions.

 ""I wouldn't have expected this to compile. You define float amount=0. 0;, amount is a float 0.

Does anyone happen to have code I can use or adapt? I've been working on this for a while haven't gotten the syntax right. Thanks., Usability,""
 'Off hand, this would be easy enough using JQuery, since terms of it\'s selector syntax, all tags would be referred to by something like the following: $ ( "" img "" ) And, then you should be able to easily enough loop through all images, check if they have an alt tag, add it to an output string, which you could then do something with. If you want to have a look JQuery, that w3schools. com tutorial page / reference material is most likely your best bet: using javascript itself, I am guessing something like the following would be a collection / array of document elements, you could check their type, retrieve alt tags, etc. etc.: document. elements'
 'jQuery would be difficult to load into a bookmarklet. As it is JavaScript provides an images collection itself: document. images. / / this is untested code but gives the idea var altText; For ( i=0; i<document. images. length; i++ ) { altText += document. images [ i ]. alt + "" \\ n ""; } newWindow = window. open ( "" "", "" alt text "" ); newWindow. document. write ( altText ); Of course to make a bookmarklet you have to add the "" javasciprt: "" prefix to it escape the quotes etc. Some discussion:'
 'Hi, idea came from this site: You construct a little piece of JavaScript put it your browser favorites, run it, but it acts on the page you are currently looking. I wanted to just give this to someone to put their favorites, because they wanted to make sure that when they were constructing alternative text that it described their images correctly. This was a person who really cares about accessibility, so I was trying to do them a favor.'
 'Hi, Thank you. I will definitely check this out.'
 'Hi Rather than just focussing on this one issue, maybe it would be worth your friend looking one of the various accessibility validators? These will not only highlight whether images have alt text associated with them but also many other potential accessibility issues.'
 ""Not really relevant, but a package called greaseMonkey lets you apply your own javascript wrappers to other guys websites, making use of their DOM's etc. as well, so it means you can sort of modify / customise javascript interaction with other guys websites, while it's primarily for fireFox, there's a version specific to IE as well: they also then have sort of sharing libraries where guys share their javascript wrappers for various sites with each other, etc. I did also past play around with actually using JQuery greaseMonkey scripts, it also did work, but anyway.""
 ""Oh yes, the reason I looked into greaseMonkey first place is it would possibly, sort of let us customise a webpage, etc. for a specific group, without affecting it's interface for other, larger target markets, etc., but anyway.""
 'Hi, This is a good suggestion. This was a specialized case, though. She wanted to go over the alt text with the developer. friend was writing content, the developer was doing the programming. She wanted to write the alt text for the developer to plug. She was hoping to look the images the alt text together with no other clutter on the screen to distract her. Thanks.'
 ""Hi I also feel this approach could provide solutions to a number of issues with popular sites. Indeed, you can find scripts under accessibility on userscripts. org which can be helpful. problem is that you do need to know a little javascript be pretty adept DOM inspection manipulation to produce scripts efficiently - something that can take a while to familiarise yourself with. For techies this isn't a big problem but how many of us have time to devote to this sort of thing. I'd love to be able to spend more time doing this kind of work but just don't have the time to do so. And then when you consider the increasing adoption of Web 2. 0 techniques sites continually changing potentially rendering scripts useless, the initial attraction to this approach looses some of it's appeal. Nevertheless, I do know that people are working on scripts which improve the accessibility of some sites for those who are aware of the technology how to use it, it does still offer a very compelling solution my view, particularly when other efforts to improve the accessibility of a site fail. And with Chrome FF supporting such browser extensions natively now ( or least Chrome anyway ), as well as improved means for auto - updating scripts, it could still be worth maybe looking into whether there would be sufficient demand to provide such a service. _ _ _ _ _""
 ""Well, honestly, javascript etc. is still one of the skills I play around with quite often, but, yes, never really got around to it too much myself as such - but this made me think that least one site have put together recently, I might be able to specifically implement something like this to help any screen reader users out there, but, let's see...""
 ""This can be a useful technique times, especially when retrofitting the accessibility of third party sites that don't have a very good handle on accessibility. One thing to keep mind though, JavaScript bookmarklets can only hold a certain amount of code within the url, but you can work around this by referencing an external configuration script. An example of this technique can be found the bottom of the page is a JavaScript bookmarklet that automatically makes the Facebook chat web dialog accessible to JAWS12 - 13 NVDA users using IE8 - 9 or Firefox., sites such as these should be including these features their web applications from the start, bookmarklets can only temporarily make up for deficiencies their UI designs until the programmers change the code render the bookmarklet useless.""]","['james.homme' 'jacobk' 'travis' 'james.homme' 'james.homme' 'ian.sharpe'

2632,Blocking-some-pseudoDHTML-events-in-shopping-site-listboxes-using-greaseMonkey,"[', this actually now worked out ( I think ) way too easy... LOL! Apart from including the JQuery script library my script file that was then mentioned for the specific domain / site, the relevant gm4ie file, all I added was the following: $ ( document ). ready ( function ( ) { $ ( "" select "" ). click ( function ( event ) { alert ( "" clicked "" ); event. preventDefault ( ); } ); / / end of select click } ); / / end of document ready For a bit of an explanation of the above - FWIW, when using JQuery, the following line of script attaches an event handler to all tags: $ ( "" select "" ). click ( function ( event ) { then starts off your handling code block, which gets finished off with the ending } );, the event object can be used to determine attributes etc. of the object sending the event request, the event. preventDefault ( ) function call blocks the default event handler as such, so while this one is still performing, it seems to be diverting least one piece of initial activity or something, somehow. Also, all your own script chunks get enclosed inside the $ ( document ). ready ( function ( ) { } ); piece so that they will only get interpreted / assigned to objects after the page has finished loading all of its content, to make sure nothing gets misinterpreted / missed out on. I added that alert ( ) function call to make sure this was actually getting triggered / executed, while it doesn\'t seem to be all the time that I would expect it to, the one thing I now did pick up on was when I focused on the final listbox, before arrowing up down, which made it reload, but generally without necessarily having known which product category was meant to be selected, as long as I first hit the space bar, as opposed to hitting enter etc., this event does get triggered, but without page being reloaded, so that then if it hadn\'t yet changed category yet, it would then, or else, when I then did arrow up down, it was fact taking note of the selection change. I did also now try this without grease monkey activating / loading its script for this page, it seems to work quite a bit better now that have been able to figure out what keystrokes do actually work better terms of triggering javascript events, which wasn\'t too sure of before, but think for now, while will take out alert, might keep it loading, try out a couple more things with it, but, the main thing is it does work, conjunction with JQuery on other people\'s / site\'s document object models, which was somewhat of an irritation the past. So, anyway, just want to say, thanks!'
 ""No problem. a couple more thoughts. Firstly, many sites now already use jQuery. If the jQuery library has already been loaded by the page itself, you don't need to load it. this will improve performance but may lead to a little extra complexity checking for the libraries existance. Secondly, you may want to take a look the jQuery HotKey library. Can't remember where I found it but am sure google will serve you well. Basically, it make it extremely easy to associate hotkeys to the various keypress events on any element selector. jQuery is beautiful.""
 ""Yup. Have used JQuery to catch keypress events, etc., was very simple / easy,, yes, if a site is / was using JQuery, wouldn't need to load it, but did for this site. Other joke is think you can even use it to move mouse cursors around, so you could keep a site blind friendly, mess the sighted guys around if you wanted using mouseOver events to make the mouse relatively useless...""]",['jacobk' 'ian.sharpe' 'jacobk'],"['https://www.freelists.org/post/program-l/Blocking-some-pseudoDHTML-events-in-shopping-site-listboxes-using-greaseMonkey'

In the factory package you can find more schemas make to work with IDEs using colors intendations. But anybody can make your own reading schema based on the factory defaults. It is easy but a little bit time consuming process. But easily can be the SayLine ( ) function overrided then JAWS can anything tell you what you want.

 'I find it easier to use the "" say indented characters "" setting found under text processing - >geneeral the jaws settings center, turn that on for program editors no others.'
 ""Wouldn't it be nice if any UIA / MSAA provider provided this kind of information appropriately ( i. e. number of tabs or number of spaces )?""
 'text provider is already a bitch to implement ( I know as I\'ve done it for a multi - line edit window class ). And I\'m not sure how you would expect to do it, the movement units that UIA supports are characters words lines pages the like, not "" leading whitespace "".'
 'Agreed - it was just blue sky thinking.'
 'So, let me toss this out there. What WOULD you guys want? I\'m just throwing pasta the wall here, but what about a \' tick \' or something the beginning of a line for each tab? Something like "" for int I equals 3... "". That would indicate that the given line is indented with three tabs. If the ticks were subtle quick but not too quick as to be indiscernible, do you think this would be an improvement?'
 'Honestly, I very much like what jaws already does if you enable say indented characters. I simply set my indentation level to 1 per tab. And if I ever need to work with others I then use an external pretty printer that transforms it back to what sighted users like. That way as I move up down it will say ( for example ) "" one tab "" when I move from global scope to a function body, then not say anything about indentation until it changes, so on. Having it set to \'1\' removes the need to do any mental arithmetic to turn "" 15 spaces "" into "" 5 indents "". I would not like a sound per level all, that would require mental counting. ( just as I don\'t care for things that use pitch gradients to indicate things, absolute pitch change - as jaws does to indicate capitalized letters for example - is okay but not varying where I would have to try compare two tones to extract any meaning ).'
 'I agree about counting ticks. However, a different tone for different levels may be useful when reviewing with speech. Something quickly easily discernable such as piano notes you can usually tell the difference between major notes. I am not sure if you can already do this JAWS. I do have my JAWS set to use notes for objects on web pages, a piano note for buttons a different one for links, it is faster than having JAWS say "" link "" all the time.'
 ""Hi, I put the idea forward the hope that this kind of support could become screen - reader independent. I like 's idea, but I think it would need to be an Accessibility check box Tools|Options so as not to disrupt users who want to do it a different way, such as yourself. I tend to use code beautifiers before committing my code presenting it for review, as I'm absolutely favour of indentation standards, but sometimes rather poor doing it: )""]","['s0201608' 'florianbeijers' 'danteg' 'tim.burgess' 'danteg'

 ""Actually, that depends on what options were chosen during installation. If they do a standard installation, then yes, you get all the languages. But you can choose to not install certain components, or even set the default profile so that the other components are hidden. Ask whoever installed it to see what they did before hunting for something that might not be there. Either way, however, from an accessibility point of view, there isn't any real significant difference because they all use the same IDE. Some have a few features available which others don't, but on the whole, they're not significant when it comes to the accessibility of Visual Studio out of the box., I think you probably need to do a bit more reading on the basics of. NET Visual Studio 2005. There is plenty of information the online help regarding the personalisation of the development environment. There is virtually nothing that I can think of that you need to do order to make Visual Studio as accessible as it's going to get. mind that JAWS 6. 10 is * very * old hat nowadays, I would easily blame any accessibility problems you're having on JAWS, rather than Visual Studio using that combination. Once you upgrade to JAWS 9, things will improve, although almost none of the improvement is due to JAWS 9 itself. Most of the corrections enhancements are to be found JAWS 7.

Nothing I have tried has worked. postings seem to say that you must include the headers windows. h mmsystem. h. A couple of people also said that you must LINK to winmm. lib your additional dependencies configuration your compiler, but I have no idea what that means or how to do it. I am using MS Visual Studio Express I find no items the dropdown menus that appear to cover this. So what is the secret to getting this playsound to work? - -'
 'First, my question is whether or not you know much of c++. If you haven\'t had much experience, here\'s some starters. First, when you "" link "" to a library, this is what happens - - the compiler compiles the code, just like a good compiler, or maybe not since I don\'t see many clean compiles, but anyway... Second, the linker comes, does some optomization of it\'s own, links up all the object files generated by the compiler into one big executable. This means that all the functions get combined, externs get referenced etc. During this point, you can link to static libraries that include functions. You can do it through the properties gui of vs, or you can do something like: # pragma comment ( lib, "" foo. lib "" ) to tell vs to link to that lib file. Second: If you need help with a function, your best shot is to google it. googling PlaySound brought up the first result, which happens to be msdn: this page, we see: BOOL PlaySound ( LPCTSTR pszSound, HMODULE hmod, DWORD fdwSound ); so we see that it takes 3 arguments returns a BOOL. By looking the argument types, you can tell what\'s expected sometimes, but if not, you can read a little lower than the prototype find out for sure. first argument as we can see is the path of a sound. second param is a handle to the module with a resource; if you\'re not supplying the sound as a resource, just set it to NULL. third value is a set of flags. If you have more than one flag, you can bit - or them together like so: flag1|flag2|flag3 And loewr than that, we see the expected return value, which you should be checking. Below the remarks section is a nice example ( a lot of the functions usually have an example, or a larger example that shows how to use a collection of functions ).'

 'years ago working another language I used a technique where I calculated the sizes of the controls before displaying the form to adjust for font size. If I remember it went something like: Dim myNewFontSize As Integer = 14 Dim myNewLineHeight As Integer = _ Math. Ceiling ( myNewFontHeight + (. 10 * MyNewFontHeight ) What this did was to set a line height to whatever the font size is plus 10 percent bigger. I also used this technique, I think, to calculate the modified length RePosition controls so they aligned pretty much correctly based on the additional size of the string or content being loaded. I always ensured the length of an object greater than the max value of the length based on content max font size so only horizontal alignment was necessary if I remember. Now this does not adjust padding inside the control nor does it calculate the needed length nor does it adjust the controls on the form so they stay aligned dont overlap as mentioined above but it should adjust the contents of a UI object so a single line is not cropped vertically me thinks. I havent done this, no code, perhaps 15 years now so use the concept but check it for validity before counting on it for your needs. Note that when you set a font size the designer the control size is automatically adjusted for size changes padding included although positioning is not changed. Also, specifying one of the auto size properties might handle vertical font size changes but I dont think that is the case, not sure since I just dont remember.']",['pmorales' 'ofbgmail'],"['https://www.freelists.org/post/program-l/How-increase-control-font-size-but-also-height-of-of-controls'

I\'m doing it this way because I need the other language\'s functionality, the script would be a bear to debug / maintain if it were done entirely the JAWS scripting language ( "" JSL ""? ). I\'m using the JAWS COM API to make it speak / stop speaking, run JAWS functions as necessary etc. it\'s working well. But there is no way to pass parameters or get return values from the JAWS functions using the COM API, so I used the clipboard ( since JSL has the "" GetClipboardText ( ) "" function ). But I\'ve been looking for a better way, I\'m thinking since file I / O is a basic feature of any language there must be a way to do it JSL.'
 'JAWS has INI file functions built such as IniReaString ( ) IniWriteString ( ). If you need more flexibility most scripters end up using the Scripting. FilesystemObject.

 'Okay, so I\'ve got most of it working, but I\'ve encountered Bugzilla have another question ( LOL ): So here\'s the deal: I\'ve set up a string function that takes a string parameter returns a string value, another place set up a string variable that will take that value ( so as you can see there are no ints involved whatsoever ); yet the compiler is saying it expects the variable to be of type int, not string. And as usual I didn\'t find on FSDN. This is my code:; place another function that calls it var String params = GetParameters ( ); function definition String Function GetParameters ( ) var string sValue = IniReadString ( "" AHK "", "" Parameters "", "" "", "" C: \\ \\ Media \\ \\ Software \\ \\ ahk2jaws. ini "" ) return sValue EndFunction As you can see, no ints. No floats or doubles or numbers of any type, just strings... so where the heck is it getting int? I\'ve checked the documentation of IniReadString it returns a string ( unlike IniWriteString which actually does return an int ) Could it be something the internal implementation of these functions maybe?'
 'I ’ ve seen this “ bug ” when functions are used before they ’ re declared. I assume that you are just writing the. jss file, the script is calling GetParameters ( ) before it is defined. If you want to use functions regardless of where they appear the code you have to add their definitions to the documentation. jsd file. shorthand way is to not do this but then you must define the function before its used.'
 ""Okay, gotcha. Another similarity to C / C++, though syntactically it's more like VB. Net ( LOL ). Anyway, thanks for the info; moving things around did the trick. Thanks.""
 'So sorry to bug, but I have another question ( LOL ): does JAWS require any kind of special permissions to read files certain locations? it out:; This worked. var String params = IniReadString ( "" AHK "", "" Parameters "", "" "", "" \\ \\ \\ \\ lcf - fl. org \\ \\ LW - UserShare \\ \\ HomeFolders \\ \\ mfox \\ \\ Profile \\ \\ Desktop \\ \\ test. ini "" ); This didn\'t. var String params = IniReadString ( "" AHK "", "" Parameters "", "" "", "" C: \\ \\ Media \\ \\ Software \\ \\ ahk2jaws. ini "" ) Both files exist are the right place ( verified this with FileExist functions both languages visually ) compiler was cool with both ( no syntax errors ) I used the correct slash formatting. So, the only thing I can think of is that maybe for some reason JAWS needs an elevated level of permissions to read ( which is weird because my INI write function works perfectly ). What do you think?'
 'I do not know, your guess is as good as mine.'
 'Yeah, I\'ve given up on the INI thing... clearly, something behind the scenes is preventing it from working. read write functions work perfectly the other language, the write function works JSL, but the read doesn\'t. So back to the drawing board: do you happen to know if JSL supports running programs with command - line parameters? Its Run function doesn\'t say much one way or the other. If so, I think I\'ll just create a little script the other language that takes care of the IO stuff. If not, back to the drawing board, again ( LOL ). By the way, a couple of side questions: In the INI functions, what does "" flush "" mean? I know where I\'d like to flush them right now, but I doubt they\'re talking about that. * smile *. Also, do you know of any documentation "" for programmers "", maybe a forum somewhere, or any other place to get these kinds of questions answered? FSDN is great for beginners, but the more I get into it the more I find it just doesn\'t say. I really appreciate all your help, but I\'m sure you ( the others getting all these e - mails ) are getting tired of it. Thanks again for everything.'
 'Yes I ’ ve heard the Ini functions can be finicky, I ’ ve not actualy used them. Probably partially why the scripting. FilesystemObject code is around. run function will run whatever string you put it, its basically like the Windows run dialog. If you allow user input for the parameters you could have a security risk but assuming that ’ s not a problem or you ’ re the only one using it anyways so security who cares, then that should work. There is a JAWS scripting mailing list, much like program - l, on Freelists. / /'
 'Thanks for the info. I will check them out. In this case there is no security risk; I\'m talking about a little 5 - line program that will write a string passed as a command - line parameter to a predefined text file ( so the main script would then read that file to get info from JAWS ); users can do more damage than that with Notepad ( LOL ). I just realized though that the problem of how to get JAWS to read a string from the other script would still be an issue, though. So that is probably not the way to go. But anyway, I looked up the "" Scripting. FilesystemObject "" object on MSDN ( not FSDN ) found references to it for C #, VB. Net, JavaScript. Is this a COM object, a. Net object, or something else? I didn\'t know JAWS could even create objects outside of its own little world ( LOL ). Anyway, thanks again - now that I got something that\'s on MSDN, I know I\'ll eventually get it to work. * smile *.'
 'Yes JAWS script can use COM. CreateObject ( ) function JAWS script creates an actual COM object. So you have the full power of Scripting. FilesystemObject as documented MSDN once you create the object. If you are feeling creative know COM you can make your own COM objects then use them from JAWS to. If you read the UIAutomation summary from FS you will notice it also can receive callbacks from COM but I think this may be limited to specific calls from UIAutomation that JAWS is expecting.'
 ""Well the end of the day, I finally got my act together ( LOL ). Thank you so much for working with me on this. Now I have read write functions that are working great. I do know COM, not how to create my own COM objects ( * yet * ), but I've used COM extensively other languages ( mostly AutoHotkey but also some C # ), so as soon as I saw it was a COM object I was good to go! * smile *""]","['mfox32322' 'travis' 'mfox32322' 'mfox32322' 'mfox32322' 'travis'

It appears that next word prior word are not reading for me the code editor. Has anyone else experienced this situation? If yes, how did you fix it? Thanks!'
 'MessageAlso, say current word doesn\'t work either... insert+num pad 5. I keep hearing "" getting started "" which is being read from the start page.

Finally, speak next character prior character works fine... it is just next word, prior word, current word will not speak properly. Also, this is happening vs 2005 pro code editor as well... I cannot seem to get jaws 9 to speak the code editor syntax with next / prior word nor with current word. Has anyone else experienced this if so, how did you resolve it? Any suggestions welcomed!'
 ""Seems to work fine for me, but I also ( normally ) use the Ctrl + Arrow keys which is sort of built into windows. Only problem with that one is that it sometimes to get a bit stuck terms of what it reads if there's a lot of punctuation a bit of code, so will have to try out the Insert + arrow keys a bit more.""
 ""I'm puzzled by this since others reported that the default JAWS scripts for reading by word now worked better than the custom ones that the scripts previously used. You can restore the old functionality by renaming the function called OldSayWord to SayWord recompiling. Let us know if that makes the difference.""
 'This seemed to be from the start page being opened when I was programming the code editor. I went to tools / options set an empty environment to show rather than the start page when the program opens. This fixed it. only thing I can gather is that jaws was seeing the start page it was causing it to not be able to read by word correctly.'
 'Hi, Does it work if you use the standard Windows keystroke of ctrl+left ctrl+right to move by word? I usually find the standard keystrokes are more reliable than JAWS alternatives. standard keystrokes for movement by word certainly speak for me OK last time I looked.'
 'MessageHi, No, that did not work either. to try something, I set my startup options to open to an empty environment ratehr than to start by showing the start page. For whatever reason, this fixed it. For some reason, jaws was getting confused seeing the start page on top of the code editor would not read by word. I have my environment setup to be a multiple document environment no windows are docked. I made sure I maximized the code editor just to try to get jaws 9 to work. I have no clue why this was happening but this seemed to fix it. Thanks,'

1115,Deploying-VB6-App-with-MSI,"['Hi, Because I\'m wanting to get the advantages of MSI packages, I was wondering if there was an "" easy "" way to package a VB6 application into an MSI file. I tried the Visual Studio Installer 1. 1 some time ago, but found it too limited that it didn\'t seem to allow the packaging of remote component registry entries for the client. I also didn\'t find the tool to be terribly accessible. Take it as read that I\'m not looking to buy an expensive packaging tool or have to take time out to learn a whole new scripting environment. Time just doesn\'t allow it. I did wonder whether it might be technically possible to put all the VB6 COM components, such as the exe the tlb files into an empty VB. NET project, use VS. NET\'s deployment project to create a setup package. But since the deployment projects are primarily designed for deploying managed code, I suspect the business of registering all the COM components would be a tedious manual task. Anybody got any ideas?'
 'Hi, I know little about MSI, but case you are open to other setup packagers, let me make sure you are aware of the free program called Inno Setup, available from It uses an ini type file for specifying the files features the resulting setup executable, including whether to register COM servers, create registry entries, etc. options are possible, so there is a learning curve. I have found the program to be powerful reliable though, would be glad to answer questions about its use.'
 ""Hi, Thanks for the info. However, I'm specifically wanting to use MSI / Windows Installer packages, for the various administrative advertising advantages they provide. E. g. the ability to repair an installation, roll - back installations, link them to network software management utilities we use here. I don't have any problem with creating a setup executable using the standard Package Deployment Wizard included Visual Studio 6. But it just doesn't produce the type of package I want.""
 'Hello. A few years back there was a product created by Microsoft called visual installer if not mistaken. It was for visual studio 6 applications. It let you create msi files using almost the exact interface vs 2003 but for vb 6 programs. It was a stand alone application you could d / l from microsoft. Sorry I cannot recall the exact name, but I used it for vb 6 apps it was good. Maybe google for it? Or if anyone else recalls it on list?'
 ""sorry david just read this one looks like you already tried the one I was referring too. I use inno setup for package / deployment it comes built with a step through wizzard so you don't have to script much. I can send you any code snip its you might need to install / register ocx or active x dll files etc. I use it primarily for vb 6 deployment. I still use version 2 from a while back had no need to transition to any newer version since version 2 works fine for me is slightly scaled down from the newer versions. Inno is the only thing I can think of. don't use the package deployment wizard grin.""
 ""Hi, my previous reply to regarding Inno Setup. I specifically want to create MSI files, not executable setup files. Although I know the PDW is a bit flaky places, I've successfully used it for many years so don't have any real problems with it per se. It just doesn't produce MSI files.""

I'd rather avoid adding redundant code to the project order to use the ctrl+shift+slash keystroke, as it ends up being the equivalent of adding MessageBox statements all over the place.: - ) In VS2008 I find the ability to filter the Error extremely useful, especially when using the code analysis features.

157,Does-windows-narrator-has-an-API,"[""Hello, Does windows narrator has an API allowing to control it from another program? IF yes, where can I find information about it? As you certainly know, I'm the author of UniversalSpeech is an API that connect to the current screen reader to control it. currently supports Jaws, NVDA, plus a few other less used screen readers. Before windows 10, narrator was so bad that it was anyway pretty useless. Since windows 10, while being far from Jaws or NVDA, it is now usable for basic things, I think that it could now be interesting to support it. Does anyone has any information? what do you think? As a reminder, I'm open to contributions to support new screen readers under windows, or to port the library to mac, linux or other OS. Feel free to contact me. For those who had doubts about the license, it has been changed to MIT. Thank you.""
 ""I don't BELIEVE it does, but I could be wrong. Let me follow up with the Narrator team put you contact with them. - -""
 ""I did some research, it looks like Narrator uses SAPI. So if you're thinking of implementing only the basic speech functions ( speak cancel speech ) then supporting SAPI is enough; it can even be used to set the voice, rate, volume etc. ( but from the look of this awesome library of yours, you probably already knew that 😁 ). And I'm like 99 % sure that Narrator uses UIA, so between SAPI UIA we already have an impressive API to do stuff like Narrator. Obviously this isn't the same as extending Narrator itself, but as far as speech is concerned your library already does it; when users choose SAPI, it would use the same default settings used by Narrator. PS: Thanks for the invitation to contribute! I would be glad to help any way I can, though I don't see what else could be added to UniversalSpeech - from what I can see it's already pretty amazing! I've been using Tolk, but I'll be trying it out soon!: )""

 ""Hello, I did some research, it looks like Narrator uses SAPI. So if you're thinking of implementing only the basic speech functions ( speak cancel speech ) then supporting SAPI is enough; it can even be used to set the voice, rate, volume etc. ( but from the look of this awesome library of yours, you probably already knew that ). Yes, of course I know that narrator use SAPI. But supporting narrator supporting SAPI isn't exactly the same thing. On iOS, think about apps that use speech directly rather than making VoiceOver speak. result is that, more or less frequently, you get two voices speaking the same time. It's annoying of course you potentially lose information because it's impossible to follow the two voices the same time. Apps made that way don't always require you to quit VO, you must live with the two voices. Remember that, when you quit VO, it means that you entirely rely on the app to read all the UI. It isn't always desirable. It's probably good for a game but perhaps not something else. We can make the same paralel for narrator vs. SAPI, with the addition that those who are going to use narrator are more likely to be beginners, who may not know or be afraid of pressing Ctrl+Win+Enter. They are more likely to be beginners, otherwise they would certinly be using NVDA or Jaws.""
 ""Hello, I also would be very interested knowing if there is any exposed API. Especially if it can be accessed via python. If there is one, you necessarily will be able to access it python. There aren't 36 possibiilities. If there's an API, whether it's a COM interface, or a direct access some DLL. In the two cases there are python libraries, pycom or ctypes.""
 ""Hi, Hypothetically, if Narrator exposes COM ( Component Object Model ) based API, it would be possible to let Narrator perform certain actions. This should not be confused with SAPI ( Speech API ), as SAPI just lets you code speech sequences deal with just speech aspects. On the other hand, a fully - fledged scripting interface ( even via COM ) could allow Narrator to deal with certain apps better ( that's how one can extend JAWS NVDA the first place ). to where Narrator comes from current limitations, scripting interface will only work on a future feature update to Windows 10 where this is first introduced ( akin to modern keyboard layout introduced with Version 1809 / build 17763 ). UI Automation is easy to work with as narrator wants to deal with how the world is coded UIA ( take a look IAccessible2 to UIA bridge work 19H1, for instance ), but we ( developers scripters of third - party screen readers ) know that most interesting applications do not implement UIA all, or some cases, any meaningful way of obtaining what we need with even MSAA fails ( some cases, spectacularly ). As a person who've dealt with Windows 10's accessibility from day 1 with screen readers ( writing an add - on numerous pull requests for one such screen reader ), I do understand what it feels like to teach screen readers to deal with apps ( some cases, Windows 10 features ) certain way. Is Narrator perfect can a scripting system for it help out with many apps? Can scripts for third - party screen readers solve all sorts of issues that pops up on Windows 10 apps? No no, but we ( Microsoft people, third - party screen reader developers, some app vendors, a growing number of science students instructors ) are seeing a trend where people are starting to realize that attitudes matter when dealing with accessibility, some app vendors have actually begun to take accessibility feedback seriously ( take Microsoft Google, for example ). For those who know the NVDA add - on I'm talking about, I created that add - on ( back 2015 ) to not only show progress support for Windows 10 features apps, but for a more important reason: showing respect to screen reader users taking their feedback seriously. Microsoft added developer mode to Narrator 2016 to demonstrate the same reason as me creating an NVDA add - on: to advise app developers that they should not ignore feedback from screen reader users by showing them what Narrator would show do as blind users use the ( I don't think is part of this forum, if not, I encourage you all to ask for advice from him regarding best practices for app accessibility ). Going back to the topic hand, to be honest, I don't think scripting capability Narrator ( if it shows up ) won't solve the underlying issue that powers the original question about necessity for such an API set. underlying issue hand is not screen reader support extensions, but rather assumptions from some app vendors that they can ignore feedback from screen reader users developers. Sure, we can teach someone how to teach Narrator to do such such thing with a scripting interface, but that won't serve as a good educational opportunity to remind people that, more often than not, accessibility depends on what's going on within their minds rather than what's front of them. this helps, apologies for a lot of what appeared to be rants from a fellow screen reader developer.""
 ""There is a simple way to get narrator to say something you want while not interfering playing nicely with other narrator output. It only works on later versions of win 10 though. UIARaiseNotificationEvent can send any arbitrary string to narrator to read aloud to the user any time any priority order with other narrator concurrent speech: don't know if this is powerful enough for what you want but it is a start. Thanks, bill""
 'Hi, Ah, this one... A few things about this function: * with any UIA client ( not just Narrator ) that supports IUIAutomation5, supported since Windows 10 Version 1709 ) Creators Update / build 16299; I am the one who brought it to NVDA exactly a year ago ). * This must be sent from an object that is either a native UIA element or an MSAA control that can expose UIA information via COM / QueryInterface method ( see function signature for details ). * It can do more than string output - it can control how incoming notifications should be processed what kind of notification it is. * There are certain Windows 10 apps that uses this method extensively ( sometimes causing efficiency problems; Calculator app is one such example ). complete function signature is ( using a basic C++ syntax ): Int UiaRaiseNotificationEvent ( UIAElement * sender, int notificationKind, int notificationProcessing, char * displayString, char * activityId ) { } Or Python: def UiaRaiseNotificationEvent ( sender, notificationKind, notificationProcessing, displayString, activityId ): pass'
 ""Hello, This function seem interesting, but I don't understand all what parameters have to be passed. I have never implemented anything using UIA. I have only done raw old win32 apps, now I'm using WXWidgets for newer apps since this year. WXWidgets only supports MSAA currently. It could be an interesting way to dig, but perhaps not for today: learn how to use UIA, help WXWidgets team to switch from MSAA to UIA for accessibility support... Another question: when you say that you have implemented that function for NVDA, does it means that a call to it also triggers NVDA to speak? What's the current implmentation state for Jaws others? Thank you""
 ""Hi, Since I seem to recall that this list membership aren't entirely based on programming experience, I'll try my best to accommodate for those who may not know what we're talking about: Before getting into how notification event works, I think it'd be best to give some folks a really high - level overview of what UI Automation is: UI Automation, as you may have heard ( or not ), replaces Microsoft Active Accessibility ( MSAA ), otherwise known as IAccessible. Similar to MSAA ( but not quite though ), UIA uses UI tree to represent all sorts of controls ( termed UIA elements ), each element exposes a set of COM interfaces properties for clients ( assistive technologies such as screen readers ) to query servers ( apps ) to set. In UIA world, an important property named automation ID is used to differentiate one element from another; least that's what is supposed to happen according to Microsoft Docs, but reality, not all UIA server implementations ( apps ) adhere to this ( sometimes presenting wrong automation ID string, sometimes ships with no automation ID all, some other cases ). But for the most part, UIA elements that comes with various Microsoft apps do come with discernable automation ID text, thus screen readers can provide additional support ( or sometimes workarounds ) for various elements on screen 9and apps ). In addition to UIA elements automation ID ( there are other properties, too ), UIA uses events to facilitate communication between clients servers. In addition to usual events such as focus movement name change events, UIA ships with additional events for specific situations such as controller for ( auto - suggest accessibility ) notification ( see below ). recently, Windows 10 Version 1809 ( October 2018 Update ), to help screen readers cope with unresponsive applications guard against apps that send a lot of events once, Microsoft added connection recovery event coalescing flags for UIA clients ( IUIAutomation6 ). Regarding notification event: introduced IUIAutomation5 ( Windows 10 version 1709 ), it is used by UIA servers ( apps ) to let clients ( screen readers, for instance ) announce text deemed important ( perhaps useful ) by apps. For example, while opening a website Microsoft, the main process ( microsoftedge. exe ) sends UIA notification event to tell clients to announce page loading progress. This then causes UIA ( UIAutomationCore. dll ) to loop through list of clients that are listening to this event pass on parameters from notification event to clients so they can do whatever they wish. In order for clients to receive notification event notification ( no pun intended ), a client would register an event handler for this event. This handler must take the following parameters, which are same as UiaRaiseNotificationEvent function to be called from servers: * Sender: the UIA element that raised this event ( to be specific, the element that the app feels should send this event ). * Notification kind: the action ( or a kind ) that triggered this notification ( item getting selected, etc. ). * Notification processing: how clients should process notifications, mostly dealing with how speech sequence must be set interrupted. * Display string: the actual notification content. * Activity ID: the activity ID string associated with this notification assisting clients choose best course of action based on what the activity is. Once the notification event is received, clients have freedom to do whatever they wish to do. Some clients elect to announce notifications regardless of what it is how it should be processed ( default implementation NVDA, I assume JAWS as well ); some would heed notification processing instruction ( Narrator, for example ); some may choose to ignore it completely ( unless they didn't register an event handler for this ); some may choose to announce only notifications that are actually useful important ( more recent NVDA releases with Windows 10 App Essentials add - on installed ).

If not, what other Linux distributions work with the 3 B+ that have screen readers to install? I know that I can use Windows to set it all up. I have no problem doing so with SSH. I prefer to have a screen reader running locally, since the 3 B+ has a 3. 5 inch audio jack. Eventually, this PI will be installed on my 20 foot boat will need to use it with a Bluetooth speaker. So having an onboard screen reader is a must. Here are the items I purchased. I am providing them on here case someone is interested. I will send an updated post on how the whole kit performs once installed. I understand this may not matter to most of us who are totally blind, but the PI case is transparent. This means that someone with sight can see everything on the board. I bought the transparent case to impress sighted friends. Eventually, my goal is to set up both a depth fish finder using Python 3. I have a 2016 Tahoe 550 TF with 150 horsepower outboard engine. I use it for both fishing water sports with my family. I want to be able to hear the depth that the boat is, as some of the lakes Minnesota are shallow. I do not want that prop to hit the bottom if I am pulling up to the dock. I also want to be able to use my fish finder, which currently runs on my iPhone on the Raspberry PI to free up my phone for other uses. Purchased * Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ Mini Computer with Performance Heatsink Set < * Samsung 128GB 100MB / s ( U3 ) MicroSD EVO < * Miuzei Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Heat Sinks, 5V 2. 5A Supply, Compatible with Raspberry 3 Model B+, Pi 3 Model B < Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -'

1676,windows-forms-in-net,"[""Hi all, Using vs 2003 vb. net had a few questions on windows forms. I've read up quite a bit on this but wondering what is the best practise. if I have frmLogon frmMain I want to unload frmLogon show frmMain once the user supplies the correct criteria. For example: log on click dim frm as frmMain ' user passed criteria frmMain. Show ( ) End Sub Some say to hide frmLogon do not unload it. Some say to place frmMain outside of the frmLogon make it public to frmLogon. Some say to create a reference to frmMain frmLog on the opposite forms via a member variable. Once frmMain, this form will have around 15 forms that it will have to show to the user the user must interact with. What is the best way to show / hide forms vb. net? You have to create an instance of each form, understood, but what about showing / hiding forms? Is it that you show / hide it never unload them from memory until the application exits? What is the best practise this routine of things? thanks!""
 ""Hi, As with most things, best practice depends on what the desired result is. Normally, you don't want to carry around anything memory, or using up resources, longer than is absolutely necessary. Tidying up behind you is a sadly dying art the programming world. Anyway, if your frmLogon screen is * never * going to be shown again during the life of your application, then best practice would be to lose it as soon as it is finished with. So that case, unload it immediately after showing frmMain. On the other hand, if frmLogon might need to be displayed to request the user to enter more credentials, or log into another part of the system, then hang on to it. One way to have the logon screen only be used the start of the application, is to create a Sub your Windows project, which you set as your start - up object. In the main, you can show the frmLogon, then only if that is successfully negotiated, start the system for real by using the Application. Run ( frmMain ) to kick off the rest of the system. If the logon fails, then just close the system down after showing an appropriate message. only time I hide a form, rather than unload it, is if I know the subsequent form is going to return to the one that called it. That is, if I want the state of that form to be maintained while other forms are being used. If I don't care what information is on the calling form, don't care how the user gets back to it, then I tend to unload the form, reload it again later when it is needed. In one system I am working on currently, we have an MDI parent form, which is always visible. A design decision was taken that all normal forms, i. e. not dialogs, that the user passes through would always be visible. It was decided that when a form opens another form, closing the child form would always return to the same instance of the parent form that opened it. To achieve that, I added a CallingForm property to our standard inherited form class, so that every time a form is instantiated, it can be explicitly told which form instance to return to when closed. This is because the Owner MDIParent properties have more specific meaning, couldn't be used for that purpose without damaging the normal behaviour of the forms. Remember that the JIT compiler will optimise code use, the CLR will manage code loading for you. So if you have a form which is frequently used, but whose state is never maintained, then the CLR will use the library loaded into memory next time you load the form, rather than getting it from disk again. You can help this process by putting forms which have a similar lifecycle into a common DLL. That way, as soon as one form from that library is loaded into memory, the assembly for the others will also have been loaded, making it quicker to load them too. One thing I learned really early my VB career, actually 's VB4 course, was that you should always show the child form first, before unloading or hiding the parent form. This reduces screen flicker on slower machines, gives a thoroughly smoother experience. How you manage the form the background is up to you, depending on your application's requirements. So summary, all your suggestions can be good practice. It just depends on what your criteria for success are.""
 'Hi, you can show the main form application startup: FrmMain _ load subroutine, you can show FrmLogon, that overspreads FrmMain. In subroutine Logon _ click, if the data are correctly been entered, you can call FrmLogon. close ( ). form will close the control returns to FrmMain. Otherwise, you can set a label text to represent error data submission with the string LblLogon. text = "" error login, try again "" leave the form active.'
 'Hi, thanks for the info. when I call Application. start pass it frmMain, when I go to show different forms from frmMain, do I dim the new form from within frmMain then show it? Or do I keep forms elsewhere like a module? In other words, will frmMain have all the form members that I can enstantiate or do I keep them elsewhere like a module? Finally, what is a good way to keep global data available for all forms the project. For example, once the user logs, store the user name, id,'
 'Hi thank you for the input.'
 ""Hi, Where you declare your form variables depends on what you want their scope to be. If you know all your forms are going to have a lifetime within that of frmMain, you will always want to access the object variables that instantiated them, then encapsulation might indicate that you declare the form variables frmMain. But if you wanted to be able to instantiate a form variable frmMain, but reference that variable from another form, then you could declare it a public or variable a module. Since all the Windows applications I build here have an MDI parent form, we declare instantiate all our forms that, as the application itself has the same lifetime as the MDI form. However, we only declare instantiate them as when they are wanted, not as an up - front exercise as some applications do. You have a few options for global data, depending on whether we're talking about a desktop application or an enterprise, client / server type one. For global data, you can create a module, declare your global variables there as or Public. That's the nearest you will get to the old VB6 Global declaration. What kind of variable you use for this is up to you. For example, one system, I have a structure defined the common module, which represents all the identification security permission information about the currently logged on user. So when I want to know if a user has update permission on a given part of the system, I can simply check CurrentUser. Update for or False. Alternatively, you could create a User class which is instantiated the logon screen, but whose variable is declared the main module, so that it can be accessed from anywhere the project. Another option is to serialise data to disk, read it back from any class which needs to access it. That is clearly a bit of an overhead, but makes sharing data between projects a solution easier, sharing it between users on enterprise systems practical without writing to a database. One thing I would say is, be very sure that you really do want the data to be global. AS you know,. NET other object oriented development systems tend to dissuade the use of global memory variables. It compromises stateless objects, means you have to manage the global data carefully. You might find that some circumstances aren't actually global data, but simply parameters which need to be passed around from object to object. That way, only the objects involved the transaction can see the data, rather than any object the system. Forms are often not global really, but simply need to be referenced between specific instances of other forms for one reason or another. So those cases, you may just want to create a form property to hold a reference to the desired form, rather than making it available to everything, such as the CallingForm property I mentioned before. So let scope access guide you. If genuinely all form instances need to be available from any part of the system, then make the variables public the project. But if that's not the case, just declare them the scope they are used, pass references to them as parameters the occasions when it is needed.""
 'Hi, thanks for the input. You mentioned... Alternatively, you could create a User class which is instantiated the logon screen, but whose variable is declared the main module, so that it can be accessed from anywhere the project. so that would be like: module public oUser as User end module then the log on form do... oUser= new User ( id, name ) is that correct? Also you mentioned doing a friend structure a moduel... did you do something like this: module public friend structure name as string id as Integer end structure end module thanks for any input.'
 'HI, Yes on both counts, with one slight modification. Smile> Structure CurrentUser Id As Integer NetworkName As String FullName As String Role As String Update As Boolean End Structure is the same as Public, but restricts access to classes within the same project.'

 'Hi For NVDA, you need Python 32 - bits. Besides that, you can install several versions of Python separate folders - as you already noted. To be able to run the 32 64 bits versions separately, copy each python executable their own folder, zo make a duplicate of all of them en call it, for example, py232. exe, py264. exe, py332. exe py364. exe. Now, you can run these commands from the command prompt or PowerShell. Please, do * NOT * forget that NVDA uses Python 2 ( 32 bits ) that Python 3 has a slightly different syntax than Python 2 … It could cause issues when running Python 3 source code NVDA / Python 2.

3377,Voice-synthesizers,"[""Hello, I'm trying to describe a basic sense what the difference is between different speech synthesizers are. I'm working with San Opera to get their subtitles accessible, but the first version only has the voice using the Microsoft. I'm trying to figure out how to have them provide the most versatility for users when it comes to synthesizers speed while still restricting the screen reader to only read what the application's output is. What they have now is an application that is showing text through real - time scrolling. text pops up large print while the reads it. There is also a volume control by using system key left right arrow. That's about as advanced as it is this point. I'd like it if they could have different voices both the opera I are wanting Braille display support. Below is my message to the guy. I really don't know what I'm talking about, so if someone could please explain what I should put please let me know. Message: I was able to watch the Opera just fine. It would be nice if I had a smaller thing to hold on my lap than a laptop, although a laptop really will be fine if nothing else is present. I'd love to have a button to cycle through different voices. speech synthesizer Eloquence is the most widely used. I'm not sure if you can use the windows reader with Eloquence, but you can use NVDA with SAPI. Also, some versions of SAPI have a multitude of voices. I use the voices. NVDA is a full blown screen reader closer to what users will be familiar with. Often what they do is grab information from standard output. I'm not sure of the process, but the reader is reacting to things before the screen or mouse get to it. Here's a description of what the screen reader does: is a link to NVDA: thing that NVDA many other screen readers have is the ability to connect to Braille displays. Jaws window eyes: two most popular screen readers have the most support for Braille displays, but they cost a little may be just way more than you need. If you wanted to program for users to use it on their personal computers, support for Jaws or Window Eyes along with NVDA would be recommended though. Here are some Braille displays: the displays that are out now have the ability to act as a keyboard as well as a display. This way one doesn't need to move their hands from the Braille order to move through their. I really don't think there will need to be any commands other than show last subtitle. displays have specific scrolling keys that will allow the reader to read through what's being shown on the screen without actually changing the content or giving any commands to the. It would be like your eyes going over the screen. Often though readers aren't as fast reading on the display as the words are going through, so if the previous subtitles stayed up for a while after the next subtitles came, fast sections there would be time to read everything. Possibly each subtitle can last 30 seconds more for each new title that's up, or just set the time as 90 seconds for every subtitle. There is also a more common kind of display, something like the Apex, Braille Sense, or mate: are little PDAs that have operating systems, most commonly based off a windows platform. What can happen is that your tablet or master can have drivers for all of these PDAs that way one just needs to bring their own PDA order to connect with Bluetooth to the. I believe that some button has to be clicked on the order to connect with the display, but once the display is up, it will act just like the focus 40 or brailliant. What can also happen with these more advanced displays is the ability for them to also read with speech along with the Braille, but I believe that will be a byproduct of making the screen readable by the Braille display. If I were you I'd just focus on making the above products work, but something that will need to also happen is a guard on the application that will keep users from getting out of the application onto the through their Bluetooth keyboard ability. Thank you,""
 ""Okay, is a SAPI ( version 5 ) voice. It should be pretty easy from a technical standpoint to install any other SAPI 5 voice that matches the operating system profile ( 32 or 64 bit ) have it work place of. You would of course need to license these other voices, that is one benefit of using, you already have a license for it. I believe there is a SAPI eloquence available, though I don't know the licensing terms. I've looked into this sort of thing a little bit, the sort of thing you are doing seems very much line with what most voice providers are usually thinking about terms of their product licensing ( as compared to directly selling use licenses to end users, many companies are not set up to do that all ). One question I would ask, over an entire performance ( several hours I assume? ) how much of this time is the user actually going to be using this device? If it's only a few minutes out of the entire show I would expect people to put up with a less than ideal voice, so long as they can understand it. From what I understand of what you are doing ( from this message when you brought up the topic before ) I would not expect a full screen reader to be all appropriate. You want something much closer to an appliance type device. smaller the device though the more difficult braille support would be. Also, something to keep mind about braille is that such equipment is expensive enough that you would pretty much have to rely on your patrons to bring their own they are not going to have the same devices, where with audio only equipment it can be inexpensive enough that the house could provide it ( perhaps with a small deposit ). Having a known set of hardware makes tasks like this far easier.""
 ""Hello, user will be using the synthesizer to listen to the subtitles being read aloud for the 2 - 6 hour Opera. There will be support for a Braille display as well. idea is that there will be a small windows device that is almost exclusively reading the subtitles as well as providing a Bluetooth signal so one can connect their Braille display to the device I was thinking a screen reader like NVDA would be nice because NVDA comes with support for many of the Braille displays out there already. Of course not all of the Braille displays will be supported, just the common ones the ones who aren ’ t a behind about giving you their drivers. Do you know where one can get the license for more voices? I am looking my NVDA options I see SAPI4 if I use SAPI 4 voices, I have more than I have SAPI 5. Is this because I have a product that uses SAPI 4 licenses voices to SAPI 4? They would just need one group of voices because most people are fine as long as they have more than the typical guy. (? ) What I was saying was it may be cheaper easier if they had a master running the software with a strong Bluetooth signal what would be given to patrons would either be a receiver with a remote for some personal preference's or the user could bring their own Braille Display connect. house was thinking they would possibly have one or two Braille displays, but because they are so darn expensive, their main thing would be the audio. But they also want patrons to have the ability to connect their Apex or Brailliant to the network order to use their private equipment. That way if a multitude of blind patrons come, the few who have their own technology can use it while those who don't can get theirs from the Opera. This would also provide easy distributing to other Opera houses around the world for houses who don't have enough money for a Braille display, patrons can just use their own. I hope I'm making sense... Thank you,""
 ""If you are showing lots of sapi 4 voices then it is probably something you have installed. sapi 4 is quite old now not nearly as featureful as sapi 5. If you are using a that you have a screen reader installed on, especially one that has had 32 bit jaws for quite awhile I would expect you to show lots lots of real speak sapi voices. I don't know braille devices well enough to know whether most of them already have Bluetooth support, I thought they were mostly USB or serial devices.""]",['brandonboy13' 'soronel.haetir' 'brandonboy13' 'soronel.haetir'],"['https://www.freelists.org/post/program-l/Voice-synthesizers'

4472,Deprication-of-Skype-Desktop-API-SkypeTalking-and-JAWS-Scripts-For-Skype,"[""Hi list. I'm sure everyone knows about this now ( refer to subject line ). I had to install Skype version 6. 9 on a new ( you can obtain it from the Skype site ) so that I can still use SkypeTalking the JFW scripts for Skype. I'm refusing the update each time Skype starts, but I'm wondering how long I would be able to continue on version 6. 9. Does anyone perhaps know of an alternative plan to get SkypeTalking to work on the modern versions of Skype ( 6. 11 upwards )? I'm a heavy user of SkypeTalking for work purposes, attempting to do without was extremely frustrating an environment where we usually have 6 to 9 very active group chats with some of them more than 10 participants. Apparently SkypeTalking makes use of Skype4Py - a Python hook into the Skype Desktop API. new direction of Skype is to use a URI approach, where everything is a sort of message - response protocol. I'm not sure if Skype4Py could be rewritten to make use of this URI message - response protocol, since from my limited investigation I did not see all the features that the now depercated Desktop API had to offer. Any advice would be much appreciated.""
 'Have you tried gwconnect? could answer your needs its a standalone app.'
 ""Hello, URI has also limited features, so you can't acquire about various Skype events. You can just call send messages. be something changed the meantime, but it looked to me quite limited when I was searching for info on how it works. SkypeTalking works with Skype 6. 11 as far as I know, since some of my friends told me that. However, will it still work e. g. Skype 7. 0 or not, oh that's a big question. deprication of Skype API is also the main biggest reason why I stopped developing SkypeTalking. When I got an info on Microsoft's decision to completely kill legacy Skype API, I definitely decided to discontinue the program forever. Although it still works even after December 2013 when Microsoft announced to kill the legacy API, it certainly doesn't mean that it will not be killed the next version of Skype. future plans are may be, may be, porting the SkypeTalking to Linux where legacy API hopefully still works good, since Skype for Linux is not frequently updated. Of course I have to check that out detail before I begin.""
 ""GwConnect makes use of the same API. Therefore, it will not live very much longer either I guess. Maybe they'll rewrite it, but I doubt it.""
 'SkypeTalking worked with an earlier version of 6. 11, but a further 6. 11 version was released if I can remember correctly, it stopped working there. IMO, none of the other Skype accessibility solutions can come close to what SkypeTalking can do, so well done for it! This does not mean that the other accessibility solutions for Skype can not be made to do all that SkypeTalking does of course: - ). GWConnect, as far as I know, also use the Skype Desktop API, so it will also stop working. Should we not perhaps rally additional voices from other accessibility groups, then approach Skype explain what the deprecation of the API implies for all of us? Surely something can be done about all of this.'

A few weeks back I picked up a PDF of the book "" Thinking Forth "", which is really a text on software engineering as a whole, while it uses the FORTH language to illustrate concepts remarkably current relevant to today\'s software engineering challenges best practices ( extreme programming, iterative approaches, modularity, bottom - up design, unit testing ). All of those concepts for a book that saw the a few decades ago. question to the list: has any of you had some descent experience programming FORTH, especially as a blind programmer?'

So, rather than the language having any useful constructs for solving real world problems, it is a very flexible redesignable language. You can make it what you want it to be. However, it seems to have fallen out of favour for a number of reasons. first is that it requires you to think bottom up all the training that programmers get is thinking top down - if you ever try to write an OS from scratch, you will quickly find that top down works a lot better for applications than it does for operating systems. Visually oriented programming languages stole the centre stage. OOP was a co - star. Higher level languages got'

217,Feedback-Request-Code-Navigation,"['folks, We recently did a usability study on the Visual Studio editor one particular point came up multiple times. Simply put, when the user navigates to an unknown location ( e. g. after a Find / Replace or with a Go To Definition ), the screen reader doesn\'t give enough feedback on what\'s happening. usability study asked the user to replace all instances of one string with another EXCEPT for an instance on a specific line, it came up multiple times that the feedback was insufficient to make the task easy. This brought us to a more general question. If the user takes an action that causes the insertion point to move to a different location, what would be the best information to convey? Note that the navigation MAY or MAY NOT have something selected as a result ( e. g. Find / Replace would select the information that matches the find string but Go To Definition would not ). Logically, there are a few pieces of information that seem useful: 1. What is selected after the navigation ( if anything ) 2. What file is currently active 3. What line is the user on 4. What is on the line we just arrived on So, for instance, if you navigated heard "" MyCodeFile. cs Line 218 public void methodname open paren... "", would that be the right thing to say? Is the order right ( should the line number come before the file? ). If something is selected, should that be announced first, last or not all? I know there are keystrokes to read the current line current selection... should we just leave those off let you decide what you want to hear? Are there cases where this experience should be different? For instance, if you\'re doing a "" Find All "" trying to navigate through a dozen matches, should that give different information than a single "" Go to definition "" operation? Thanks advance for your thoughts on this,'
 'Hi, I have a few thoughts. * Only speak line numbers if they are turned on. * If text was not found, say not found the current line. * If text was found, say found the selected text, followed by the current line. name of the window, my view, would be too much information, because we know what file we are working on.'
 'Thanks, Although, I might add that some of these navigations will take you across files. Go To Definition or Find may move navigation to any arbitrary file. - -'
 'Hi, Then only report the new file if it appears the editor.'
 ""1. What is selected after the navigation ( if anything ) This is not usually useful, since find or find replace scenarios, the user already knows what they are searching for, or the replacement text. Actually I find that this is what most editors speak, since it is natural for the screen reader to announce the change selection, which again is not that useful. This is useful one situation, for users who have never used a find feature before, are not aware that find tends to select the found text. But they could figure that out pretty quickly, it would give a more efficient experience for intermediate advanced users to assume they know how find works most applications. 2. What file is currently active That one could be useful, make sure * not * to include the full file path, since that is not usually needed to distinguish one file from another the same solution / workspace, is often too verbose. 3. What line is the user on That could also be useful. 4. What is on the line we just arrived on This one is definitely useful, since it gives context about the specific instance found, or replaced. Off hand ( before you out the options ) I would have just said to announce the line that you found or replaced on. But I see that hearing the file line might also be quite helpful. Your example sounds pretty great for the common case: “ MyCodeFile. cs Line 218 public void methodname One thing I would change: Make the announcement of the file name only occur if we are doing find or find replace across multiple files. When I do a find the current file, reminding me what file I am is annoying. I already know. You could possibly extend this to only announce the file name if it is different than the last found or replaced item, so even if I am finding across many files, if the first file has 1 occurance, the second has 10, I hear the file on the first find, then once on the first find the second file, then just line numbers line text for the next 9 times I hit F3, since they are all the same file. Actually, I usually hit F8 to move to the next found item when I am doing a find all Visual Studio. Reducing the spoken information to only things that have actually changed is a well known user interface design technique for the blind. Is the order right ( should the line number come before the file? ). Yes, the order is right, once you make it omit the file name if it is already obvious. If something is selected, should that be announced first, last or not all? I would say either not all, or last. I know there are keystrokes to read the current line current selection … should we just leave those off let you decide what you want to hear? users are already used to having to press extra key strokes to announce the current line after doing a find notepad, notepad++, Visual Studio, probably almost every other editor. If you can speak what we want to hear the most common scenarios, it saves us keystrokes which is nice. When an editor stays silent, it just means it didn't consider the blind user experience all for that scenario. For the go to definition, you can speak the same things, file, line number, line text, omitting the file name if it is the same file that was already active. I see mentioned that it should only speak line numbers if line numbers are enabled settings. I disagree. I will never turn line numbers on to be read on every line as I move up down a file, that is * way * too verbose. Yet, when I am running a search, or go to definition, hearing the line number that my cursor jumped to could be useful. If there were 2 separate settings, one for line numbers the front of each line, one for line numbers announced when finding or going to definition, then a setting would be nice. But if you are going to combine them a single setting, I will always leave it turned off. that helps. ~""
 'Hi,'
 'as additional feedback from a blind developer, I agree with all that called out below. Thanks.'
 'This set of suggestions looks sane to me.'
 'I\'m a Java programmer so my experience is not with Visual Studio. I generally agree with although I think line number should be the last thing to get announced. "" MyCodeFile. cs public void methodname ( ) Line 218 "" When editing code or navigating using things such as view implementation or view all callers I almost never pay attention to the line number. I generally only find line numbers useful the following situations. 1. I have a stack trace that I am using to analyze crashes. Line numbers are obviously important. 2. When viewing build output line numbers are useful. While I often go to the exact place of the error if there\'s a bunch of errors a small section of code I will use line numbers to navigate look the code. 3. When viewing differences code I use line numbers. I find the most efficient way to do code reviews is with git format - patch. I then read the raw patch file will reference line numbers my IDE if I need more context.'
 'Thanks all for the feedback. One trend I ’ ve been seeing among sighted users that I ’ m curious how screen reader users might think … very few people actually “ LOOK ” the line numbers. People will use “ Go - to ” to jump to a particular line number, but nobody looks over to the left mentally thinks through “ I ’ m on line 428 I know my error is on line 271, which is about 4 pages up … ” or anything like that. I find it interesting that nobody cares what line they ’ re ON, but they care about what line they WANT to be on. Do folks agree? Additionally, as always, THANK YOU all for your feedback. I ’ m going to share this feedback with the VSCode VS for teams as well the hopes of consistency across the products. - - D'
 ""I think I would agree with that. Line numbers become important when I'm debugging a coding error or a stack trace ( or running grep - n looking the output ) I need to jump to a specific line. I don't think that I ever care about what line I'm on once I'm reading through code.""
 ""Hello, Globally, I would say that the information should be given from the most broad to the most precise. by this logic, the file name must be given first, followed by the class name ( if different from the file name or if there are several the same file ), method / function name, finally the line number. Having the method / function name is obviously much important to determine where you have just landed than the exact line number. Compare this as if you were dropped from an airplane a random place on the earth. You don't care about the exact GPS position, but first would prefer know if you have landed a city or the desert; then which continent, which country, which city or what are the nearest cities, finally only the exact address or GPS position, but only the end. I find it interesting that nobody cares what line they ’ re ON, but they care about what line they WANT to be on. Yes that seems funny, but I agree with the previous post, it's so because we only need line numbers very special situations, for example when debugging. same as we don't need the exact GPS position all the time our daily lives; we need it only when we are said to meet precisely somewhere because something is happening there.""
 ""I generally agree with. I find line numbers to be useful when I first look unfamiliar code. Specifically when opening a new file I will often jump to the bottom view the line number to get an idea of how large the file is. I will also jump from the top to the bottom of functions view the line number difference to see if I'm dealing with a long function. I suspect sited developers can just scrol get an idea of how long things are. As far as I can tell there's no way for me to currently do this VS Code. Using a recent version of VS Code Jaws 2019 I can not figure out how to read line column number.""
 'Hi, When I get line numbers error messages, I too enter the line on which there is an error jump to it. I do not care what my current line number is.'
 'This is awesome feedback. In VS for sighted users, there is the “ map mode ” on the scrollbar that shows a graphical representation of the file. It ’ s great for that “ quick glance ” to see how long methods are. Jumping to the end of the file saying “ What line am I on now ” seems particularly useful. I wonder if having that information an easier way to consume makes sense … almost like a sort of “ Info ” on methods. Granted, method length CAN mean simple * LOTS * of comments, but as a general yardstick, it makes sense … - - D'
 'Currently, we don\'t intend to say the method or class that you\'ve fallen into. I immediately bring up two questions: 1 ) It\'s possible to determine what method you\'re from the method comboboxes the top. A sighted user can glance these a screen reader user can get focus up there to figure that out... but would it be useful to make that information more easily collected? 2 ) By extension, I\'m almost thinking there should be a generic "" Where am I? "" command. Perhaps it would say the details you just specified... Filename,, Method Name, Line Number. Make that generic Were am I command bindable to a keyboard shortcut ( or include it the HelpText all times ), then on a long navigation, automatically read that off. Does the make sense? For C # files, many people have the Filename match, but I don\'t think that\'s a universal truth. Naturally, if you\'re white space between methods, we wouldn\'t mention anything for the Method name... Any additional feedback here would be wonderful thanks again to all who have contributed here. I fully intend to share this all with VS Code VS for with the intent of a consistent experience across products. - - D'
 'Hello, Yes, all of those ideas are excellent would be extremely helpful, especially a keystroke to report "" where am I? "" When a search occurs, it would be very helpful to say the surrounding function name, along with the other pieces of information described so well by others on this list. Thank you, R & D Software JBT Corporation | Automated Systems 400 Highpoint Drive Chalfont, PA 18914,'
 'Hello, First of all, I realize it now; I\'m sorry to have jumped the middle of the discussion. I don\'t use visual studio myself, because I have been discouraged from the first screen installation process. I may manage to install try it if you help me install it with the components I want... the setup is totally not understandable, there are far too many choices. 1 ) It\'s possible to determine what method you\'re from the method comboboxes the top.... but would it be useful to make that information more easily collected? It\'s probably almost as fast to jump to the beginning of the method using a shortcut like the Ctrl+Shift+Up of eclipse then back to where you landed, than try to reach such a combobox with tab / F6 navigation, or by a alt+letter shortcut to the combobox then back to the editor. So yes, it\'s certainly interesting to obtain the information a simpler way. combobox will obviously be much more useful when you want to actually jump to a particular method. 2 ) By extension, I\'m almost thinking there should be a generic "" Where am I? "" command. Perhaps it would say the details you just specified... where am I function seem even more interesting than the # 1 above, because you can request it any time. If you implement this # 2, then # 1 become useless. A part of the where am I could be read automatically each time you make a significant jump. Does the make sense? For C # files, many people have the Filename match, but I don\'t think that\'s a universal truth. Naturally, if you\'re white space between methods, we wouldn\'t mention anything for the Method name... It\'s true Java C #, but maybe not other languages. I especially think about Python, JavaScript C++, where you aren\'t strictly obliged to do so by language rules ( even if it\'s a common recommanded organization ). Ideally, the class name should be given only if it doesn\'t match the filename. Or given or not given depending on the language, i. e. no for Java C #, perhaps yes for Python JavaScript. For the blank space between methods, it\'s a good question. I don\'t know if it\'s better to say nothing, or the nearest method above ( saying nothing only when being the imports or head comments ) I notice finally that all these things should be fact highly customizable, because we have all different habits, different wishes of thigs to be announced or not different moments.'
 "", First off, yes, I would like to help you get VS installed. Let's take that as a""
 'In VS 2010 I use NVDA object navigation, pressing NVDA + numpad 4 to view the method drop down, again to view the class drop down. I press control G to hear what line I am currently on, then NVDA + numpad 4 to hear the total number of lines, then escape to return to the editor. ( Or as does, I press control End to jump to the end of the file, then control G to hear the current line, depending on whether losing my current place the file would be bothersome. ) A where am I hot key is a good thing, especially if the method class drop downs are harder to find newer versions of VS. \'s suggestion of putting the line number the end instead of the start also seems fine. It feels more correct to put it the front when you consider \'s suggestion of announcing more general to more specific, first file, then line number, then line text. But practice the line number may not be useful that often, so might be better to leave the end, since you can always wait to hear it the few cases where it matters. I\'m leaning more toward \'s suggestion of putting it ath the end now. I do think the file name still makes sense the front, since it can often be omitted, has higher importance. I think these sorts of decisions become more clear once you can actually use them practice. In my own note editor, I use control up down to jump to the front of paragraphs, I have it announce the number of lines I jumped before the text of the first line of the paragraph. I initially had it say "" X lines jumped "", but eventually switched to having it just say the number not the words "" lines jumped "", since I want that extra information to be as unobtrusive as possible. Knowing how many lines I jumped is helpful letting me know how much of the file I am jumping over, since I cannot visibly see that. Sometimes even saying just the number seems a bit too obtrusive, but I think it is still worth it for keeping me knowledgable about how far I am jumping. I\'m not saying you should put that sort of feature VS, just throwing it out as an example of something that is less clear theory, more clear practice, even then still the wrong choice some moments. Also, omitting the extra words my own note editor works well for me since I know what the number means, but VS it is probably best to always be clear by saying the word "" line "". I\'m not that concerned about hearing what class method I\'ve jumped to, because I have a simple way to find that with NVDA object navigation as mentioned above. Finding the right balance between giving enough information not being too verbose is really important. I\'m building my own code editor ( for languages other than C # ) am shortly going to fiddle with an idea of using alt arrow keys to navigate scope. left moves to the first line a parent scope, alt right moves to the first line a child scope, alt up down move between siblings the current scope, where scope is determined by indentation ( or statement versus child code block if you have a hook into the compiler of your programming language. ) This lets you navigate the code scoping as though it were a tree view. I would also remember the inner scope so you could quickly move to outer scopes with alt left to get an idea of where you are, then move back to where you were with alt right. This is sort of like when you are column 40 a line you navigate down by line VS or notepad++, it remembers the column so you always end up on column 40 if there are that many characters a line, even if you cross a line with no characters on it. Contrast that with plain old notepad that does not remember you were on column 40 if you cross an empty line while pressing down arrow. This scope navigation idea is something I\'ve wished I had VS, but not sure if you have available hot keys like alt arrows, or even if you could make it happen since you also have to cater to sighted users. It is even better than a where am I hot key or method / class drop downs since I can quickly find out that I am a certain else if branch, of a certain foreach loop, of a certain method, of a certain class. It lets me hear each one individually, quickly skip passed the ones I already know, then quickly navigate back to where I started. Contrast that with a where am I hot key that would be too verbose if listing the loop condition branches I am, so has to stick with class method. Another thing I loved VS 2010, that disappeared newer versions is the ability to navigate the "" go to definition "" history with control shift 7 control shift 8. I am well aware of the ability to navigate the caret jump point history with control - control shift -, I use that sometimes even VS 2010, but I find navigating the go to definition history more useful since it is less cluttered than the caret jump point history. throwing that out there case someone wants to re - add a perfectly good feature VS used to have. Having many options for navigating code with the keyboard is crucial to letting a blind user move around a code base quickly. Go to definition, find all references, find text, go to line, moving through the go to definition history, moving to the matching start or end curly brace are features I use all the time VS. Moving to the matching start or end curly brace is done by pressing control shift right bracket on a curly brace, which selects everything within the curly braces, then you can press left or right to go to the start or end curly brace. Interesting to note that selecting everything between the curly braces is usually not that useful to me, but the fact that I can use it to navigate to the start or end curly brace is extremely useful. And similarly, I often use the go to line dialog to find out what line I am on how many lines are the file, even though that is not its primary intent. Also note that my alt arrow scope navigation could replace my existing trick for navigating to the start end of curly braces, probably with a similar number of hot keys, the benefit that I don\'t need to get my caret exactly on the curly brace before starting the sequence of hot keys. In my note editor, control up down move by paragraph. I\'m not sure what control up down do VS, but they are easy to press hot keys that could be used for something like jumping between method class definitions. Though I often use control M O to collapse all methods then just arrow through them, which is sort of close to that behavior, but it doesn\'t let you skip passed data members. A simple thing for you to try that gets you a bit closer to the blind user experience ( while still keeping your eyes open ), is to stop using the mouse only navigate your especially Visual Studio with the keyboard. Every time you think, "" boy it is annoying to up arrow 20 times to get to the enclosing loop, condition, method, or class definition "", you can consider what hot keys might be added to make that experience better. Of course, actually closing your eyes using a screen reader will give you a much more accurate experience, since you also experience needing to navigate to the enclosing loop, condition, method, or class definition even when you don\'t need to change it, but rather when you just want to read it, there is no easier way to get that information. But I recognize that learning a screen reader, getting use to processing TTS with your mind, building a good mental model for the code rather than just being able to see it, even just having your eyes closed for extended periods of time is actually a lot harder than it sounds when someone first suggests it as a great way to experience what a blind person is experiencing. If you could write a small program that overlays the whole screen with black, is transparent for the line where the keyboard cursor is, you could keep your eyes open get closer to the blind experience because you would be hiding all information that is not on the current line. Then have TTS output to a speech viewer like NVDA provides you could even see the information from a where am I hot key or similar. Writing such a program wouldn\'t even be that hard using an always on top window with one part transparent, UIAutomation to detect where the keyboard cursor is Visual Studio so you can adjust the position of the transparency. Anyway, that is probably more than anyone wants to do, but I do think that actually experiencing the issues first hand gives you a much better intuition about how they can best be solved. quote: I\'m also not explicitly labelling any of the bits of information except the line number. So, I\'m not saying "" File MyClassAB. cs MyClassAB, etc... "" Yes, labelling every piece of information would be too verbose. As mentioned my example above, my grown note editor I don\'t even say the phrase "" lines jumped "". As I\'ve been creating some of my own tools, with a special focus on giving me the best screen reader experience, I also find that careful use of commas or semicolons a phrase help to provide a brief pause speech delimit different chunks of information. For instance, a file explorer program I built, I might have text like this: notepad. exe; 13 2009 7: 14 PM; 179 kilobytes; 1706 of 2635 That is the file name, the last modified date / time, the size, the position within the list of files. I don\'t label each, since that is obvious would be too verbose. semicolons give a brief pause so the speech doesn\'t all run together. extra space after the semicolon is just a slight benefit for braille display reading, adding an extra delimiter for my fingers. I actually have hot keys to hide some of the information when I am not interested it, but as you said, adding settings for everything VS might stop a feature from getting out the door., I like the emphasis you put on some words by putting them all caps, but just so you know, screen reader users do not hear words all caps any differently than words normal casing, so they usually won\'t know you are doing that unless they are reading the message with a braille display. I tend to use * ASTERISKS * around the word I\'m emphasizing when talking to other blind people, or I might put them all caps if I am only emailing back forth with a sighted person. You can still do it however you like, I\'m not the emphasis police, but just thought I\'d mention it case you didn\'t know. these thoughts are helpful. \u07b7 * ^� {. n�+����� - ���� \\ �i���, ��Z���jب�jy�brJ\'���g���^�\'�Z0�x % �y & j ) m��肶������ - ~���+ - �����y� } ���ǧu���Ơz� ) ��+jikz�����y�b�� ( � "" �ay+��� - faq='
 ""Hello, @ Yann> I'm building my own code editor ( for languages other than C # ) am shortly going to fiddle with an idea of using alt arrow keys to navigate scope. left moves to the first line a parent scope, alt right moves to the first line a child scope, alt up down move between siblings the current scope, where scope is determined by indentation ( or statement versus child code block if you have a hook into the compiler of your programming language. ) I'm also building my own editor, that's exactly what I have already implemented. I confirm that it's a very nice powerful way to navigate. So far I identified three modes: - Indentation, as python - Braces, as C / C++, C #, Java, JavaScript, PHP many others - XML tags ( it's messed up HTML5 because of implicit self - close like ) This lets you navigate the code scoping as though it were a tree view.""
 'Hello, First off, yes, I would like to help you get VS installed. Let\'s take that as a separate item offlist. Thank you for your help. I\'ll contact you private. Not today but next week. Note that I\'m not american not english native speaker, so it may be difficult to arrange something because of language time. > general rule is to only say what has changed. Logically, only use "" "" "" Method "" for languages where these constructs make sense. NEVER use a fully qualified path for Filename or ( Nobody needs > to hear the full namespace chain ) Yes, exactly. It\'s usually not necessary to give the full path or full class name. Would you want the full information for the first iteration? Of course, if you\'re MetA, you should presumably know that, so since it DIDN\'T say anything, you can interpolate that the filename, class method didn\'t change? Yes again. You don\'t need to repeat information if it hasn\'t changed. I\'m also not explicitly labelling any of the bits of information except the line number. So, I\'m not saying "" File MyClassAB. cs MyClassAB, etc... "" Does this feel like something that\'s useful? There is no need to clearly separate the different elements of the where am I. Even the word "" line "" is unnecessary imo. However, I would still insert punctuation: MyClass:: MyMethod: 75 SomeFile. py: SomeClass. some _ method: 27 Note that I\'m separating class name method name with the usual conventions of the language used. This may be important if someone is reading the where am I on a braille display. In fact the where am I could well be permanently located the status bar. NVDA Jaws have shortcuts to read the status bar quickly: Insert+PageDown. And if Jaws / NVDA can read it, you may get the braille display as a bonus without doing anything special. Note also the space after the colon. If the method name ends with a number, this will prevent screen readers from saying "" 1: 23 "" as "" 1 hour 23 ""'
 "": Awesome! Thanks for confirming its usefulness. to hear we both came up with the same solution.: ) And good to hear about your 3 modes, as I had not really thought about XML yet. Indentation can work for most everything, if it is combined with a tool that auto formats the code / XML / JSON. I'm writing a scripting language, it does not use braces for conditional code blocks ( similar to Lua ), so I either have to hook into the compiler, or just have a nice auto formatter that applies indenting properly. Languages like C #, Go, have auto formatting tools that can analyze the code automatically apply indenting, their are tools that do the same for XML JSON. But it is nice that your editor doesn't require them can work on the braces or angle bracket tags directly. I've also been writing a custom tree view control, addition to the standard keys you would expect, I also support the same alt arrow keys for navigating to parent, child, or siblings. I think having the consistent behavior hot keys between the tree view control the code editor will make the experience really nice intuitive. tree view also lets you toggle between viewing the full tree, as existing tree views do, or switching to a scoped menu mode, where you arrow between siblings with up or down, you can press left or right to visit your parent list or child list, just like context menus or the NVDA menu does. menu with menus view is nice because you can use arrow keys without holding alt, you can also select all siblings with control A, or move to the first or last sibling with or end. full tree view mode is also nice, because you can type letters for first letter navigation or auto find across the whole tree to quickly reach the file you want, or visit all nodes just by pressing down arrow repeatedly. I think they each have their own pros cons, it is nice to be able to switch between them on the fly to use whichever one best fits your current needs.""
 ""Hello, @ Yann> I'm writing a scripting language, it does not use braces for conditional code blocks ( similar to Lua ), so I either have to hook into the compiler, or just have a nice auto formatter that applies indenting properly. Is it your own scripting language? Because I'm also trying to create my own scripting language... Indeed, if you want to indent the code for such a language, you probably have to write a simplified version of the parser for the editor. ON my side I haven't this problem. I'm not a fan of begin / end syntax, so my language use braces. editor doesn't support Alt+Arrow keys navigation begin / end languages but you could probably write a plugin to support it. For auto - indenting independently of any editor, I'm sometimes using astyle I've also been writing a custom tree view control, addition to the standard keys you would expect, I also support the same alt arrow keys for navigating to parent, child, or siblings. Interesting. I have also though about tree view. It would especially be useful for XML; but I haven't implemented anything yet. In the editor, I don't only support Alt+Arrow to navigate, but I support also Alt+Shift+Arrows for selection, as well as Alt+Home Alt+End to go to the first / last sibling current level.""
 ""Yep, it is my own scripting language, for my next big games project. It actually uses braces for functions, loops, structs, but I preferred the end syntax for if / else conditionals. It has a minor benefit of letting the compiler be smarter about knowing where the coder missed a closing curly brace or end keyword. I don't usually miss writing closing curly braces, but the language is intended to be simple easy to pick up for beginners. It also lets me skip on parentheses around the condition, using a then keyword instead, if you have an else if or else branch, they are effectively the end keyword for the preceding block. And I felt it read a bit better a screen reader. It is a very subjective choice though. Great that you are creating your own language as well. We should keep touch. It is rare to find someone else working on both a custom editor for the blind a custom programming language. Plus we both have a lot of experience building games for the blind. I'll email you off list. Thanks for the tip about alt shift alt end, those seem like useful extensions. ~""
 'If I\'m doing a find I would want the entire line read out followed by method followed by file name with line number as the last thing spoken. So given the below method when searching for for "" to. generic. property "" I would want to hear the following. throw new DatabaseException ( getProperty ( "" to. generic. property "" ) );, method login, file login. cs, line number 20 throw new AuthenticationException ( getProperty ( "" to. generic. property "" ) );, method login, file login. cs, line number 23 public JWTToken login ( String username, String password ) { try { User u = findUserInDatabase ( username ); validateCredintials ( u, password ); return new JWTToken ( u ); } catch ( DatabaseException e ) { throw new DatabaseException ( getProperty ( "" to. generic. property "" ) ); } catch ( InvalidCredentialException e ) { throw new AuthenticationException ( getProperty ( "" to. generic. property "" ) ); } } If I\'m doing a find I care about context for a specific line as the most important information followed by the method name.

 'I believe most screen readers have a keyboard shortcut for “ me this line ”. Since there has been some dissention on whether or not it should be read automatically, should we just rely on the user to hit that keyboard shortcut? Again, an ideal would be full, dynamic configurability, but that ’ s not something we can put together right now … but if we can least improve the default experience for the better, I ’ d like to do that. - - D'
 'Requiring users to hit the say line shortcut for now with the possibility of more configuration options the future seems reasonable to me.'
 ', thanks for this. It took me a couple extra days to get a chance to read all the way through it. I love some of the uses you\'ve found that get around not having explicit commands available. Granted, I\'d prefer not having to work around those, but some cases, adding explicit commands for everything is just overwhelming. We\'re already struggling to find new keyboard commands so we\'re very hesitant to add new ones. I\'m a bit hesitant about the line number the end of the line after reading the line question. Mentally, I think of the start of what it\'s saying as the "" header "" of the line, everything from there on is the contents of the line. If you heard * INT I EQUALS STRING DOT LENGTH PLUS ONE EIGHTY SEVEN * would you realize that the 87 that was read was the line number not part of the code? I mean, sure this case from context, it\'s pretty understandable, but this is a very simple example, I yes, I know that nearly every modern language would have a semi - colon there or something, so you\'d actually get * PLUS ONE SEMICOLON EIGTHY SEVEN *, but I still am a bit concerned. But a realization I particularly heard was the information that\'s conveyed by reading NOT reading the information. Once I understand the heuristic, I can also understand that if the reader didn\'t mention the method name on a "" Find Next "", then I know I\'m still the same method. If we read it every time, you would need to mentally remember what method you were map that over. However, I think that we would still read the method name if we changed overloads of a method. By which I mean if I had MyMethod ( string name ) MyMethod ( string name, string address ), then if your FindNext jumped from one overload to the other, we\'d announce that you\'re MyMethod again. I wouldn\'t want to read the arguments that case, or would I? We\'re also working on a feature where we\'re changing where line numbers are presented to the user my customer development came up near - universally that nobody ever cares what line they\'re on. They may care about what line they * WANT * to be on, but not which one they\'re * CURRENTLY * on. That was a somewhat interesting revelation to me. thought that some cases, knowing how many lines precede follow the current line is more important that knowing what line you\'re actually on... I find that intriguing thought provoking. I\'m curious if folks have specific commands you\'ve rebound keyboard shortcuts to? If there\'s a command that\'s particularly useful, do folks go through the effort to rebind it to a keyboard shortcut that\'s easier to use? \'t take this as "" Microsoft says... "", but I feel like our keyboard map could use a major overhaul, but there\'s always the fine line of changing keyboard shortcuts might make things better breaking all the muscle memory that folks have. In the days of old, I used to hit Ctrl+Shift+B to build my VS project that got changed somewhere to be the beginning of a chord. I still hit it frequently grumble my. Last December, I set aside a week for myself went through JAWS\' screen reader training. JAWS was recommended to me as it had the friendliest tutorial for learning. By the end of that week, I could send an e - mail Outlook did a very basic Hello World application WPF. Believe me, my hat\'s off to folks who are able to make the mental model of their code... because I tried that with a super simple app managed to overwhelm myself. When I was chatting with my developer about the "" Where am I? "" button, he informed me that there already is a "" Show Structure "" button which gives a fair bit of this same information, but probably a bit too verbosely. If folks want to try it, it\'s CTRL+K, CTRL+G... but my opinion, it reads off too much. Although, on my machine today, JAWS is just sitting there staring me ( not reading ANY tooltips ), so I\'m trying to figure out if Visual Studio, JAWS or Windows is broken. And thank you for pointing out the emphasis with capital letters. I thought that screen readers used a different voice for all caps... but maybe I\'m thinking about something else. I\'ll try to remember to use * ASTERISKS * for emphasis instead of all caps. Thanks for letting me know. Finally, yes, this has all been VERY helpful.

3910,VBnet,"['Hi all. As i said days ago. I worked programming with databases ACCESS, I worked also with VB, when I was sighted. Now I have been disconnected of all this world by years, even though I need to be on the track again, i need to update me this matter. I need to learn about vb. net. How can i start this long learning process? Any advice, will be so good. Thanks'
 ""A good place to start would be to download the VB. net express edition. This is a free download I have included the link to the download. link is for the 2010 edition since I know it plays reasonably well with Jaws without scripts. While you're the Microsoft website there are plenty of tutorials offered by Microsoft to get you started with some simple programs. Maybe some of the other folks on the list can point you to other on - line tutorials language references. this helps,""
 ""Fortunately, you had a part of your life with sight so you'll have the essential visual memory to get this done. You can try find the dot net links on that site for tutorials worked code examples.""
 ""So long as isn't using jaws some other screen reader will work with those express editions, that should work. Otherwise mono - basic all dependencies very likely will be a better choice.""
 'Hi, Also, there is AutoIt.' 'What does autoit have for a price tag?'
 'It is free available from'
 'Hi, this person always sends emails an encrypted form so it is problematic... robin'
 'that is why i have him blocked.'
 ""I am a beginner with VB. net. I am working on a project, I know virtually nothing. I have seen VB syntax before, but I haven't really built anything with it. I'm piecing things together by looking examples tutorials. Is there anyone on the list who would be willing to help me through the first stages of learning how to use Visual Studio off - list? - - | Problem Solver""
 'Hi: This is a huge subject to try cover. It would take a book to try teach someone to learn to program from scratch using vb. net Visual Studio. Here are some things you might look learning to do to help normalize the learning curve some. First you need to setup the IDE for more accessibility according to your preferences. I think this is still done the Menu>Tools>Options tabbed tree view. I just installed visual studio 2015 so am not sure about what options are available for changing yet so have no recommendations but some changes make life with a screen reader much easier indeed I will post something more about this tomorrow. Then you need to learn how to navigate the ide to find out how to create a vb. net project on the desktop. You pick new>project the file menu then you select vb. net I think desktop project or something along those lines - I would actually have to google or play with the IDE to get the exact path to create a new vb. net project that should be easy enough for you to find googling visual studio 2015 create new vb. net desktop or winforms project I may do that myself tomorrow or the next day. Then you need to learn the ide tools for creating windows forms how to layout a form with controls. This means either using the default form usually named form1 or adding a windows form to the project bringing it up the forms designer setting the properties for the form like name, size, start position any other properties you want. Then dropping various controls like list boxes or text boxes or buttons on the form from the ToolBox found under the View Menu. Then you need to learn how to set the properties for each control including name, size position as well as any others you want. This means hitting f4 while the forms designer to open the Properties Window for the form then selecting a control you dropped on the form or selecting one from a list of controls listed the Properties Window setting its position size among other properties. Note that you need to either use the forms designer move controls around using jaws, never done that, or calculate the correct positioning for each control on the form based on all the other controls positions size which is my usual tactic. Then you need to learn how to add event handlers You are still the Properties Window, tab back to the tabbed list of options then right arrow to events button click it, arrow up down the list of events available for the selected control hit enter. A new event handler stub subroutine will pop up where you can enter some vb. net code to execute when that event is executed, this might be a click event for a button you could type something like MessageBox. Show ( "" You Clicked Me "" ) the code editor the Properties Window you will be back the Forms designer, close it you are back Solution you can run your project with f5 or ctrl - f5. the button the message will pop up. You will do most of your code various event handlers until you get into databases or xml files. Then you need to get up to speed with things like classes, methods, properties OOP concepts how to create them view them visual studio, usually view them Solution click on one to open it. Then you need to learn how to create manage files or databases, xml files or sql server databases are the usual file types used visual studio by default this is no small learning curve. Finally, the basics, you need to learn how to tie your data store into your form elements using something like entity framework, Ado. net or DataSets you will be there as a solid beginner. There are entire books lengthly articles created covering pretty much each one of these points to learn them from a blind persons screen reader perspective is going to take allot of time homework. I would start by looking the ide setting some of the IDE settings so the IDE works well with your screen reader of choice. As I mentioned I am about to do that perhaps tomorrow if I seen set something I will post up what I change to get ideas from other users on list from you. I use WindowEyes am experimenting with JAWS so my settings will attempt to reflect this. If it is still available I will also be setting all IDE dialogs, windows everything else I can to be a Tabbed Document so I can close them with ctrl - f4 keep them out of the way when I don\'t need them. After I post up what settings I change, I will say how to do it, if you use them or use other folks recommendations then I will tell you how to create a new windows desktop project vb. net if you want to create that type of project. Then I will help you open form1 the forms designer put a button or 2 on it, set a few properties add event handlers so you can run your project have a message pop up when you click a button. After that you should be able to learn what you need from books or googling or by asking specific questions. Later good luck! Later good luck! If you are a hobbiest you might be better off learning another language outside the Visual Studio environment. There are, or were, some stand alone visual basic program development environments or some of the scripting languages. It is tough enough to learn to create code based on real world algorythms let alone dealing with a huge complex set of IDE related complexities OOP constructs. You need to learn things like variables, math, loops how to develop your own logical structures to solve non related problems trying to do it all once is going to overwelm you me thinks.'
 ""Thanks for the info! that actually helps a lot. I am familiar with creating GUI apps other languages like, Java, C++. I just haven't ever done anything with VB. net. VS seems quite clunky since I've always avoided IDEs. Like I said, I've been looking tutorials code examples. There are just a few things I haven't been able to piece together. Plus, it would be helpful to have someone to point me the right direction from time to time. I didn't want to clutter up the list with smaller what if questions. I've already created a project added a control. Now, I'm moving on to trying to understand the code aspects of. net events.""
 'Hi: First, if you do anything, any dialog or window comes up as a result of anything you do the ide go into the menu bar by hitting alt right arrow to the Windows Menu. Then arrow up down if you see something that says set as tabbed document click it. You should have to do this only once for each new dialog or window you encounter. Most will have this option under the Windows Menu, some wont but you want everything you can set as a tabbed document set to be a tabbed document so every time something comes up, a new window or form or anything the ide try set it to be a tabbed document. I sort of peeked vs 2015 to see how it has changed then looked the IDE setup so Here is what I did... Note: These settings look like they were picked up from my older version of Visual Studio so I left them as is didnt change anything but noted some of them I remember as having set back a few years ago. There are tons of new optional settings I am not familiar with but unless I need to I wont be digging into them unless others on this list say they can help with projects or with screen reader accessibility. OK, here we go: Hit alt to open the MenuBar, might take a few seconds to open if first time. Right arrow to tools then up arrow to Options hit enter: Options window comes up with a tree view of tabbed elements. first branch is the Environment branch has like 16 branches, made no changes - allot of new options some but not aware of if they would make things better with a screen reader so left them alone. Next is the Projects Solutions branch: No changes this group so far: SourceControl: No changes. Expanded TextEditor branch, right arrow: Arrow down to all languages right arrow to expand it: arrow down to basic, right arrow to expand: I have AutoList members unchecked, parameter Information unchecked. left others alone. In Tabbs I have indent none, tab size 1 indent 1, tab insert spaces, Note that I dont like to have indentations when slogging through code with WindowEyes so dont want automatic tabs nor indents never use them but others do like use them. for vb specific: Automatic insert of end constructs left as checked for now, Note this just adds things like an End If statement if you type If the End If statement being the end construct as it were. pretty listing unchecked, enable outlining mode unchecked, automatic insertion of interface override members is checked, procedure lines is unchecked, enable Error Corrections is unchecked. Note that the error corrections is unchecked so the error window wont popup all the time while you are trying to code some vb. net code the code editor. Otherwise if you type something vb. net doesnt recognize it will pop this window while you are still trying to type something it use to grab focus making typing a problem. These are the initial settings I remember having mucked with a long time ago have worked, we will see if they still do or if one of the young bucks who use the IDE these days have better settings. Later or tomorrow I will create a vb. net test project with a couple of buttons you can follow along with to help you get started using the forms designer, solution explorer the properties window including hot keys or key strokes to get the job done..'
 'Inside these subroutine stubs enter: MessageBox. ShowMe ( "" You clicked me "" ) so it looks like: Private Sub TestButton _ ( sender As Object, e As EventArgs ) Handles TestButton. MessageBox. Show ( "" You clicked me "" ) End Sub Note to watch out for the closing parenthsis auto added since you may have automatic end constructs checked the IDE options so ensure you dont get 2 right closing "" ) ) "" Now hit ctrl - f4 to close the code editor. You are returned to the properties window. Hit ctrl - f4 again you are returned to the forms designer. IHit ctrl - f4 to close the designer answer yes when asked to save changes. Bring up solution explorer by hitting ctrl - alt - l you should hear the structure of your project with the solution branch the top, the project branch under it the bottom your form1 you just built. Arrow down past the solution branch hit f5 to run the project. button is the only control on the form focus should be on it, check it with your screen reader or mouse. You should be able to click the button the message should popup. Hit alt - f5 until you are back Visual Studio. To save your work: Hit alt - f4 to close the project click save to save the project the folder you specified when you created the project.']","['pmorales' 'rbreiten' 'jude.dashiell' 'jude.dashiell' 'james.homme'

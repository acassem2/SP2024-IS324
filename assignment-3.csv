From: Lou Barletta (Representative from Pennsylvania),facebook,"i was very proud to lead a group of my colleagues in speaking on the floor of the house last night to promote and support h.r. 3685, the protecting volunteer firefighters and emergency responders act.  this legislation is necessary to protect volunteer firefighters from unintended consequences of the affordable care act (aca).  the bill has more than 80 cosponsors, including members of both parties.  an unexpected and previously undetected problem with the law represents special and urgent circumstances.  this really took me by surprise ûò the fact that the aca could force volunteer fire companies to provide health insurance to their volunteers or pay a fine.  that would burden them with unbearable costs and possibly cause them to reduce the number of volunteers they have or shut their doors altogether.  simply put: this is a public safety issue.  iûªve been concerned that since the internal revenue service (irs) currently views volunteer firefighters as employees, fire companies and municipalities would be forced to provide health insurance or pay a fine, saddling them with unbearable financial burdens and threatening public safety.  i sent the irs a letter in november requesting a clarification, but the correspondence has gone unanswered as of today.  under the employer mandate provision, employers with 50 or more employees must provide health insurance or pay penalties.  this could be problematic for fire companies, particularly in pennsylvania where 97-percent of stations rely exclusively or mostly on volunteers.  fire companies could exceed the 50 employee threshold in several different ways: by themselves based on their size, by being part of a larger combined force under several different chiefs, or by being part of a municipality that has 50 or more public employees in total.    some fire companies may hear about this and immediately think, ûïwell, weûªve only got 25 volunteers so weûªre safe.  we donûªt have fifty.û that may not necessarily be the case.  some fire companies are considered part of their local government.  that could mean that if you take the number of firefighters ûò paid and unpaid ûò now considered employees by the irs, and add them to the number of other public employees, you can easily reach fifty, even in a small town.û",lou barletta,[],Representative,Pennsylvania

From: Daniel Coats (Senator from Indiana),facebook,this morning i offered an amendment to reform the emergency unemployment compensation (euc) program as part of legislation currently under consideration by the full senate that would extend unemployment benefits. my amendment would strengthen existing requirements to ensure unemployment benefits are going to individuals actively looking for work and individuals who truly want to return to the labor force.   the amendment would prohibit individuals from receiving euc benefits if they fail to accept any offer of suitable work (defined as work within their capabilities) or if they refuse to apply for suitable work referred to them by a state employment agency. states would have flexibility to enforce this requirement consistent with their state laws.     we need to ensure that only those who are actively seeking work but cannot find it are receiving these benefits. i have heard repeatedly from frustrated employers in indiana who have offered jobs but are told by the applicants that they would rather keep collecting unemployment benefits until they run out. this undermines the core idea of a program designed to help those only in emergency situations who are unable to secure employment.   we are waiting to see if majority leader harry reid will allow votes on republican amendments.,daniel coats,[],Senator,Indiana

From: Bob Corker (Senator from Tennessee),facebook,"senator corker has co-authored an amendment with senator john hoeven to bolster security on the nationûªs southern border as part of the immigration bill now being considered by the senate. the hoeven-corker southern border security amendment would double the number of agents on the mexican border and require implementation of a tough new border security plan before unlawful immigrants already in the country could be eligible for lawful permanent residence (lpr) or green card status 10 years after enactment. the border security plan is based on the u.s. border patrolûªs assessment of what the agency would need to maximally secure the nationûªs southern border. the amendment also strengthens interior enforcement by requiring that officials enforce current immigration law and deter overstays by initiating removal proceedings for at least 90 percent of visa overstays. ten years after enactment, the senatorsûª measure requires all five of the following conditions to be met before lpr, or a green card status, could be granted:
 
 - the department of homeland security, after consultation with the attorney general, the secretary of defense, the inspector general of the department, and the comptroller general of the united states (gao), has submitted a comprehensive southern border security strategy to congress that includes minimum requirements for each sector along the border as identified by u.s. customs and border patrol and the plan has been deployed and is operational.  
 - the border patrol has deployed, maintained, and stationed 20,000 border patrol agents on the southern border in addition to the 18,500 agents already stationed there. this means an agent every 1,000 feet along the southern border.
 - an additional 350 miles of fencing has been completed (in addition to the 350 miles of fencing already on the ground).
 - the mandatory employment verification system has been fully implemented for all employers.
 - the mandated electronic entry/exit system has been fully implemented at all international air and sea ports of entry within the united states where u.s. customs and border protection officers are currently deployed.

From: Michael Honda (Representative from California),facebook,"yesterday, speaking on the floor of the house of representatives, i shared a story that is close to my heart. a few years ago, my 96 year old mother was diagnosed with an aneurysm close to her heart. due to her advanced age, the doctors believed that surgery was too risky. a few years later that aneurysm got worse, endangering her life. she was re-evaluated, and the doctors concluded that she would not survive without surgery.  putting her faith in her doctors, in our healthcare system and in her god, she chose to have the surgery. fortunately she made a full recovery. however, none of this would have been possible without medicare. my mother worked her entire life as a domestic worker, and did not have a private pension or any option other than medicare. as congressional republicans look for an easy way out on these issues, it is people like my mother who are left behind. this is a personal issue to me and the millions of american families with similar stories.  republicans have tried for years to destroy medicare by turning it in to a voucher program. they would break the promise we made to our nationûªs seniors, that if they worked hard they would be taken care of in their old age. medicare is the most efficient health plan in our country, boasting an overhead of only 2%. the problem isnûªt medicare; itûªs the rising cost of healthcare.   one major reason our healthcare costs keep going up is because we have not changed the way patients and doctors see each other. we must be innovative and creative in tackling the cost of healthcare. as the representative of silicon valley, i have led the way in this by promoting innovative technologies such a telemedicine, personal health connected devices, and other tools. i will be reintroducing the healthcare innovation and marketplace technologies act later this year to continue this effort. most importantly, however, i will continue to stand with my friends here in the congress to protect medicare and the medicare guarantee.",michael honda,[],Representative,California

From: Bill Huizenga (Representative from Michigan),facebook,"today's jobs report is no cause for celebration. the reason behind the drop in the unemployment rate is because americans are leaving the workforce.  in fact, the labor force participation rate is at its lowest level in 35 years! we need to focus on creating an environment where innovation, small business, and entrepreneurship can thrive.    that means removing roadblocks to job creation like obamacare and dodd-frank and  making america more energy independent.  at the current rate unemployment would actually be increasing if we take into account the number of people ""left behind"" by the government's calculation.   read more from the associated press:  the drop in the unemployment rate in august to a 4å_-year low was hardly cause for celebration. the rate fell because more people stopped looking for work.  more than 300,000 people stopped working or looking for a job. their exodus shrank the so-called labor force participation rate ûó the percentage of adult americans with a job or seeking one ûó to 63.2 percent. it's the lowest participation rate since august 1978.  once people without a job stop looking for one, the government no longer counts them as unemployed. that's why the unemployment rate dropped to 7.3 percent in august from 7.4 percent in july even though 115,000 fewer people said they had jobs.  if those who left the labor force last month had still been looking for work, the unemployment rate would have risen to 7.5 percent in august.  http://bigstory.ap.org/article/why-fewer-working-age-americans-are-working",bill huizenga,[],Representative,Michigan

From: Jim McGovern (Representative from Massachusetts),facebook,"once upon a time, the gop changed a house rule to guarantee a government shutdown, (http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/the-house-gop-s-little-rule-change-that-guaranteed-a-shutdown), fulfilling a plan months in the making.(http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/us/a-federal-budget-crisis-months-in-the-planning.html?pagewanted=all)  this plan was the culmination of some 40+ votes to defund or delay the affordable care act, which gop members and leadership continually stuck to as their reason for not budging during the first days of the shutdown(http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-10-04/politics/42692181_1_funds-government-operations-government-shutdown-debt-ceiling), despite the fact the healthcare exchanges went into effect october 1st anyway.  that is, that was the argument, until it was clear they weren't getting anywhere, and instead, the gop argument started to center on the debt ceiling.(http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/republicans-gop-obamacare-government-shutdown-debt-ceiling-98102.html).  meanwhile, on the ""left"" side of the chamber,  democratic members continually tried to bring to the floor a vote on a ""clean"" budget as a compromise to reopen government. this budget - at/below gop-proposed levels passed by the senate earlier this year, had the professed bipartisan support of a majority of the house, ((http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/10/06/majority-of-house-appears-to-support-clean-cr/) but gop leadership refused to bring it to the floor, and maneuvered to block any member who tried raising it.   then, the gop agreed to raise the debt ceiling, but not open the government, as their ""compromise,""(http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/10/politics/shutdown-showdown/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=feed%3a+rss%2fcnn_allpolitics+(rss%3a+politics))....but only if it was a 6 week debt ceiling agreement...and only if was tied to conversations about how to fix our long term deficit...and only if those conversations were about cuts, and not revenues.(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-greenstein/while-government-remains_b_4066052.html)   and then, they called that tactic moving ""halfway."" (http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/10/10/boehner_we_re_meeting_halfway_on_what_obama_wants.html).  what's next? who knows what the gop will do.  but make no mistake: people across this country- children(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/10/government-shutdown-wic_n_4073146.html), military families(http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57606695/government-shutdown-hitting-veterans-military-families-hard/), seniors(http://abc10up.com/govt-shutdown-stops-food-delivery-seniors/), and many more are being hurt by this shutdown....with more to be impacted the longer this goes on.

From: Richard Neal (Representative from Massachusetts),facebook,"yesterday i introduced legislation to jumpstart the economy, grow the middle class, and fight income inequality. read the press release below to find out more:  (washington, dc / january 27, 2014): congressman richard e. neal, ranking member of the house ways and means select revenue subcommittee, last week introduced legislation to jumpstart the sluggish economy, finance critical infrastructure investments, fight income inequality and create jobs.  the invest in us act, extends and reauthorizes key bond measures beneficial for our states and municipalities, extends several critical tax credit initiatives, sets up an infrastructure bank, increases the minimum wage and provides small businesses with tax relief.  ""right now the u.s. economy is stuck in a rut, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high and the growing income inequality in america threatens to derail our economy altogether,""  neal said.  ""in december 2013, we saw the economy only add 74,000 jobs, our lowest since 2011.  according to the bureau of labor and statistics, in 2013 the economy averaged adding 183,000 jobs a month.  at this current rate, the federal reserve says the unemployment rate will remain above 6.5 percent until 2015.  this is simply unacceptable, and america can do better, and we must.   the recession has wiped out 8 million jobs, and it is imperative that we get them back.  that is why i introduced the invest in us act.  this legislation will go a long way in creating an environment where our economy can take off by making the strategic investment needed to spur growth.  furthermore, the legislation takes full aim at the growing income inequality by increasing the minimum wage, while also providing tax relief for businesses that hire new employees and buy new equipment."" below please find a summary of the legislation.  the invest in us act at a glance: tax provisions û¢ new markets tax credit ûòextends and expands the new markets tax credit program.  the new markets tax credit program is made permanent, with an allocation amount of $5 billion annually.  by permanently extending the nmtc, the legislation ensures that communities will continue to receive investments they need to renew, rebuild and refurbish neighborhoods for generations to come. û¢ build america bonds (babs) ûò makes the babs program permanent, starting with a 32 percent subsidy rate in 2013, and phasing down to a 28 percent subsidy rate in 2017 and thereafter.  babs unleash job creation, economic growth and spur private-sector investments in infrastructure.  from the inception of the program in april 2009 to when it expired at the end of 2010, there were 2,275 separate babs issues, which supported more than $181 billion of financing for new public capital infrastructure projects, such as schools, bridges and hospitals. û¢ research and development tax credit. makes permanent and expands the r&d tax credit.  the legislation also increases the the rate of the alternative simplified credit (asc) from 14 to 17 percent. û¢ amt repeal on private activity bonds ûò eliminates the alternative minimum tax (amt) on private activity bonds (pabs).  pabs are a form of municipal bonds that are used by a variety of public and non-profit entities such as airports, seaports and student loan issuers.  the amt penalty attached to these bonds results in higher interest rates which correlate to higher infrastructure project costs and higher student loan rate burdens. û¢ facility water & sewer bonds ûò exempts water and sewer projects from the private activity bond (pab) cap.  currently, the tax code limits the amount of tax-exempt private activity bond debt that can be issued annually in a state.  the legislation excludes the pabs issued by water and sewage facilities from the state volume cap.  removing the volume cap makes additional private investment capital available for these types of infrastructure facilities. û¢ work opportunity tax credit. - makes the work opportunity tax credit (wotc) permanent.  the tax credit expired at the end of 2013.  the wotc provides a federal tax credit up to $9,600 for businesses that hire targeted individuals.  since 1996, the wotc has expired numerous times.  making the credit permanent will end the uncertainty surrounding the credit for employers and potential hires. û¢ jobs training tax credit.  the legislation incorporates senator menendez's common sense proposal that links community colleges with local businesses to train employees.  like senator menendez's proposal, this bill provides $1 billion in funding for a competitive tax-credit initiative that encourages colleges and businesses to form job-training partnerships.  the proposal also would provide a community college tuition tax credit of up to $4,000 to any u.s. based business that trains a long-term unemployed person for an open job that requires a certain type of certificate or other training credential. û¢ extends increased business expensing.  this provision permanently extends the 2013 section 179 expensing and investment limitations of $500,000 and $2 million.  this provision is effective for qualifying property placed in service after december 31, 2013. û¢ permanent of the 15-year depreciation schedule. makes permanent the 15-year depreciation schedule for leasehold improvements, restaurant improvements and new construction, and retail improvements.  currently this is a temporary provision that must be extended annually.  by making this provision permanent we are providing businesses with the certainty they need to undertake capital expenditures, which fuel economic activity and create jobs.  other provisions û¢ infrastructure bank.  in 2013, the american society of civil engineers gave the united state's infrastructure a grade of d+ and estimated that the us will need to invest an additional $1.6 trillion to fix our infrastructure.  the invest in us act creates the american infrastructure financing authority (aifa), which is an independent, wholly-owned government infrastructure bank, to assist in funding some of the critical infrastructure needs.  under the proposal, department of treasury will make available $10 billion in seed money to encourage private investment in public works projects.  it is estimated that this self- sustaining entity could be capable of leveraging as much as $625 billion in private investment by issuing direct loans, loan guarantees, bonds and debt securities.  to keep both the costs and risks low, the aifa is also barred from financing more than 50 percent of any one project. increase in minimum wage.  the legislation increases the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from the current $7.25.  this increase is phased in over four years and in three increments of 95 cents.  thereafter, the minimum wage will increase as the cost of living increases.",richard neal,[],Representative,Massachusetts

From: Mark Sanford (Representative from South Carolina),facebook,"as we await the president's speech tonight with regard to executive amnesty, i thought it would be useful to read a bit of what he has said in the past on the subject. toward that end, the speaker's office circulated the list below, and i thought you might find it of interest:  ûïi take the constitution very seriously. the biggest problems that weûªre facing right now have to do with [the president] trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through congress at all. and thatûªs what i intend to reverse when iûªm president of the united states of america.û (3/31/08)  ûïweûªve got a government designed by the founders so that thereûªd be checks and balances. you donûªt want a president whoûªs too powerful or a congress thatûªs too powerful or a court thatûªs too powerful. everybodyûªs got their own role. congressûªs job is to pass legislation. the president can veto it or he can sign it. û_ i believe in the constitution and i will obey the constitution of the united states. we're not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an end-run around congress.û (5/19/08)  ûïcomprehensive reform, that's how we're going to solve this problem. û_ anybody who tells you it's going to be easy or that i can wave a magic wand and make it happen hasn't been paying attention to how this town works.û (5/5/10)  ûï[t]here are those in the immigrantsûª rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are [here] illegally with legal status, or at least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until we have better laws. ... i believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair. it would suggest to those thinking about coming here illegally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision. and this could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration. and it would also ignore the millions of people around the world who are waiting in line to come here legally. ultimately, our nation, like all nations, has the right and obligation to control its borders and set laws for residency and citizenship.  and no matter how decent they are, no matter their reasons, the 11 million who broke these laws should be held accountable.û (7/1/10)  ûïi do have an obligation to make sure that i am following some of the rules. i can't simply ignore laws that are out there. i've got to work to make sure that they are changed.û (10/14/10)  ûïi am president, i am not king. i can't do these things just by myself. we have a system of government that requires the congress to work with the executive branch to make it happen. i'm committed to making it happen, but i've got to have some partners to do it. û_ the main thing we have to do to stop deportations is to change the laws. û_ [t]he most important thing that we can do is to change the law because the way the system works ûò again, i just want to repeat, i'm president, i'm not king. if congress has laws on the books that says that people who are here who are not documented have to be deported, then i can exercise some flexibility in terms of where we deploy our resources, to focus on people who are really causing problems as a opposed to families who are just trying to work and support themselves. but there's a limit to the discretion that i can show because i am obliged to execute the law. that's what the executive branch means. i can't just make the laws up by myself. so the most important thing that we can do is focus on changing the underlying laws.û (10/25/10)  ûïamerica is a nation of laws, which means i, as the president, am obligated to enforce the law. i don't have a choice about that. that's part of my job. but i can advocate for changes in the law so that we have a country that is both respectful of the law but also continues to be a great nation of immigrants. û_ with respect to the notion that i can just suspend deportations through executive order, thatûªs just not the case, because there are laws on the books that congress has passed û_. [w]eûªve got three branches of government. congress passes the law. the executive branchûªs job is to enforce and implement those laws. and then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. there are enough laws on the books by congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president.û (3/28/11)  ûïi can't solve this problem by myself. û_ [w]e're going to have to have bipartisan support in order to make it happen. û_ i can't do it by myself. we're going to have to change the laws in congress, but i'm confident we can make it happen.û (4/20/11)  ûïi know some here wish that i could just bypass congress and change the law myself.  but thatûªs not how democracy works.  see, democracy is hard.  but itûªs right. changing our laws means doing the hard work of changing minds and changing votes, one by one.û (4/29/11)  ûïsometimes when i talk to immigration advocates, they wish i could just bypass congress and change the law myself. but thatûªs not how a democracy works. what we really need to do is to keep up the fight to pass genuine, comprehensive reform. that is the ultimate solution to this problem. that's what iûªm committed to doing.û (5/10/11)  ûïi swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books û_. now, i know some people want me to bypass congress and change the laws on my own. believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. i promise you. not just on immigration reform. but that's not how our system works. thatûªs not how our democracy functions. that's not how our constitution is written.û (7/25/11)  ûïso what weûªve tried to do is within the constraints of the laws on the books, weûªve tried to be as fair, humane, just as we can, recognizing, though, that the laws themselves need to be changed. û_ the most important thing for your viewers and listeners and readers to understand is that in order to change our laws, weûªve got to get it through the house of representatives, which is currently controlled by republicans, and weûªve got to get 60 votes in the senate. û_ administratively, we can't ignore the law. û_ i just have to continue to say this notion that somehow i can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.  we are doing everything we can administratively.  but the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that i have to enforce.  and i think thereûªs been a great disservice done to the cause of getting the dream act passed and getting comprehensive immigration passed by perpetrating the notion that somehow, by myself, i can go and do these things.  itûªs just not true. û_ we live in a democracy.  you have to pass bills through the legislature, and then i can sign it.  and if all the attention is focused away from the legislative process, then that is going to lead to a constant dead-end. we have to recognize how the system works, and then apply pressure to those places where votes can be gotten and, ultimately, we can get this thing solved.û (9/28/11)  in june 2012, president obama unilaterally granted deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca), allowing ûïeligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety û_ to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization.û he then argued that he had already done everything he could legally do on his own:  ûïnow, what iûªve always said is, as the head of the executive branch, thereûªs a limit to what i can do. part of the reason that deportations went up was congress put a whole lot of money into it, and when you have a lot of resources and a lot more agents involved, then there are going to be higher numbers. what weûªve said is, letûªs make sure that youûªre not misdirecting those resources. but weûªre still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally. and thatûªs why this continues to be a top priority of mine. û_ and we will continue to make sure that how we enforce is done as fairly and justly as possible. but until we have a law in place that provides a pathway for legalization and/or citizenship for the folks in question, weûªre going to continue to be bound by the law. û_ and so part of the challenge as president is constantly saying, û÷what authorities do i have?ûªû (9/20/12)  ûïwe are a nation of immigrants. û_ but we're also a nation of laws. so what i've said is, we need to fix a broken immigration system. and i've done everything that i can on my own[.]û (10/16/12)  ûïi'm not a king. i am the head of the executive branch of government. i'm required to follow the law. and that's what we've done. but what i've also said is, let's make sure that we're applying the law in a way that takes into account people's humanity. that's the reason that we moved forward on deferred action. within the confines of the law we said, we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law.û (1/30/13)  ûïiûªm not a king. you know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law.  and, you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws, weûªve got some discretion. we can prioritize what we do. but we canûªt simply ignore the law. when it comes to the dreamers, we were able to identify that group and say, û÷these folks are generally not a risk. theyûªre not involved in crime. û_ and so letûªs prioritize our enforcement resources.ûª but to sort through all the possible cases of everybody who might have a sympathetic story to tell is very difficult to do. this is why we need comprehensive immigration reform. to make sure that once and for all, in a way that is, you know, ratified by congress, we can say that there is a pathway to citizenship for people who are staying out of trouble, who are trying to do the right thing, whoûªve put down roots here. û_ my job is to carry out the law. and so congress gives us a whole bunch of resources. they give us an order that weûªve got to go out there and enforce the laws that are on the books.  û_ if this was an issue that i could do unilaterally i would have done it a long time ago. û_ the way our system works is congress has to pass legislation. i then get an opportunity to sign it and implement it.û (1/30/13)  ûïthis is something iûªve struggled with throughout my presidency. the problem is that iûªm the president of the united states, iûªm not the emperor of the united states. my job is to execute laws that are passed. and congress right now has not changed what i consider to be a broken immigration system. and what that means is that we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place even if we think that in many cases the results may be tragic.û (2/14/13)  ûïi think that it is very important for us to recognize that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative. i can do some things and have done some things that make a difference in the lives of people by determining how our enforcement should focus. û_ and weûªve been able to provide help through deferred action for young people û_. but this is a problem that needs to be fixed legislatively.û (7/16/13)  ûïmy job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. congress has said û÷here is the lawûª when it comes to those who are undocumented, and they've allocated a whole bunch of money for enforcement. and, what i have been able to do is to make a legal argument that i think is absolutely right, which is that given the resources that we have, we can't do everything that congress has asked us to do. what we can do is then carve out the dream act folks, saying young people who have basically grown up here are americans that we should welcome. û_ but if we start broadening that, then essentially i would be ignoring the law in a way that i think would be very difficult to defend legally. so that's not an option. û_ what i've said is there is a there's a path to get this done, and that's through congress.û (9/17/13)  ûï[i]f, in fact, i could solve all these problems without passing laws in congress, then i would do so. but weûªre also a nation of laws. thatûªs part of our tradition. and so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like i can do something by violating our laws. and what iûªm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. û_ it is not simply a matter of us just saying weûªre going to violate the law. thatûªs not our tradition. the great thing about this country is we have this wonderful process of democracy, and sometimes it is messy, and sometimes it is hard, but ultimately, justice and truth win out.û (11/25/13)  ûïi am the champion-in-chief of comprehensive immigration reform. but what iûªve said in the past remains true, which is until congress passes a new law, then i am constrained in terms of what i am able to do. what iûªve done is to use my prosecutorial discretion, because you canûªt enforce the laws across the board for 11 or 12 million people, there arenûªt the resources there.  what weûªve said is focus on folks who are engaged in criminal activity, focus on people who are engaged in gang activity. do not focus on young people, who weûªre calling dreamers û_. that already stretched my administrative capacity very far. but i was confident that that was the right thing to do. but at a certain point the reason that these deportations are taking place is, congress said, û÷you have to enforce these laws.ûª they fund the hiring of officials at the department thatûªs charged with enforcing.  and i cannot ignore those laws any more than i could ignore, you know, any of the other laws that are on the books. thatûªs why itûªs so important for us to get comprehensive immigration reform done this year.û (3/6/14)  ûïi think that i never have a green light [to push the limits of executive power].  iûªm bound by the constitution; iûªm bound by separation of powers.  there are some things we canûªt do. congress has the power of the purse, for example. û_ congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending. so i donûªt have a green light. û_ my preference in all these instances is to work with congress, because not only can congress do more, but itûªs going to be longer-lasting.û (8/6/14)",mark sanford,[],Representative,South Carolina

 to remove this obstacle in federal law, the united states house of representatives will be voting on the working families flexibility act of 2013.  this common-sense legislation allows employers to offer employees a choice between cash wages and comp time for overtime hours worked.  it is pro-family, pro-worker legislation that gives workers the flexibility to spend time with family, attend teacher conferences, care for aging parents, stay home with a newborn, or attend to other family needs that may arise.

From: Todd Young (Representative from Indiana),facebook,"for the past few weeks, i have been undecided, but leaning against, authorizing military strikes in syria.  i was willing to remain open until president obama could make his case to the american people, which he did from the east room last night.  after listening to the speech, i have not been persuaded to support military action in syria.  unfortunately, the speech left unanswered questions about whether or not the administration has a specific plan for a limited military action that will advance broader strategic objectives.  it also remains unclear what sorts of planning the administration is undertaking for various contingencies that might arise as a result of the strike.  this is consistent with the lack of detail i have received in classified briefings with administration officials.  at the very least, clarity and more forthcoming responses on these issues is necessary before i would consider supporting military action.  i hold out hope that recent diplomatic developments will bring about a peaceful resolution to the situation.  but i also realize that a deal brokered by the russians is unlikely to be, on balance, a very good deal, and will remain difficult to implement.  while we wait for the diplomatic track to play itself out, the white house must engage congress in a deeper and more open manner than they have thus far.",todd young,[],Representative,Indiana
